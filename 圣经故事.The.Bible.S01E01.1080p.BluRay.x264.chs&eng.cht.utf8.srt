有一些不尋常的東西給他

64
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,162
沒有什麼不尋常的地方，除了他有能力造成嚴重破壞

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,210
如果騷亂今天重復發生

我將粉碎任何反抗

67
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,491
起初
In the beginning,

68
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:40,038
上帝創造天地
God created the heavens and the earth.

69
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,121
上帝說
And God said,

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,294
要有光
「Let there be light!」

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,959

72
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:05,936
然後上帝分離水和天空

73
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,144
造就了海洋
He formed the seas...

74
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,944
和土地
and the land.

75
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,572
然後他覆蓋了陸地
Then he covered the land...

76
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,953
地上長出各類樹木

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,876
和植物

78
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,089
然後他傳遍世界
Then he filled the world...

79
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,971
水中有了各類生物
with all the creatures of the sea...

80
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,859
空中有了各種飛鳥

81
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,949
地上有了各種動物
And all the creatures of the ground.

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,701
然後
And then...

83
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,788
上帝創造了我們
he made us...

84
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,466
住在伊甸園中
to live in paradise,

85
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:24,435
直到  亞當和夏娃違背了上帝的旨意
until Adam and Eve disobeyed God...

86
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,813
偷食了禁果
and ate the forbidden fruit.

87
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,072
這個選擇
And with one choice...

88
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,117
讓他們辨識了
they learned both good...

89
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,945
善與惡
and evil.

90
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,454
從那之後  因為該隱殺了亞伯
Since then, since Cain killed Abel,

91
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:52,379
上帝目睹了人類內心深處太多的惡念
God has seen too much evil in human heads.

92
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,936
錯誤的選擇  錯誤的決定
Wrong choices. Wrong decisions.

93
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:16,937
導致了今天的這一切
That's why this is happening

94
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,531
我們的造物主決定凈化這片土地

95
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:31,535
上帝警告我  要我造一艘船

96
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,129
一艘能拯救我的家人和所有動物的船
A boat to save our family and all the animals.

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,053
而其他所有的生物

98
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,350
都將死亡
would die.

99
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,705
第七日
And on the seventh day,

100
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,084
上帝   歇息了
God... rested.

101
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,838
洪水吞過世界後
After the ?ood waters engulfed the world,

102
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,592
諾亞後裔有了全新的開始
the Bible describes a new beginning for Noah's descendants...

103
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,800
這也是一個人類與上帝
and a chance to restore the relationship...

104
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,261
重修舊好的契機

全能的造物主13天誕生了一個新的信仰
A new faith in an all-powerful Creator 13 being born.

106
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,696
在無數人信仰上帝前
But before billions can believe in him,

107
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,949
必定要有一人聽到他的召喚
one man must hear God's voice...

108
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,156
並願意從此追隨他
and have the faith to follow.

109
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,423
亞伯拉罕  離開你的家鄉
Abraham, leave your home...

110
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,882
我將賜予你和你的後裔新地  去那裡吧
and go to the land I will give to you and your offspring.

111
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,266

我會讓你成為萬國的父
I will make you a father of many nations,

113
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,107
你的後裔將多如繁星
with descendants as numerous as the stars.

114
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,982
地上所有的民族
All the peoples on earth...

115
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,568
皆因你得福
will be blessed through you.

116
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,779
等等我
Wait for me!

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,369
撒拉   上帝同我說話了

118
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,464
跟我來

00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,296
我的侄兒  羅得  跟我走

120
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,052
亞伯拉罕
Abraham?

121
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,477
他將指引我們去新的家園
He will lead us to a new home.

122
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,056
但我們已經有一個很好的家了
But... we have a home, a good home.

123
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,939
遠離城鎮  去一片新的陸地上
Away from the city to a new land...

124
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,360
為了我們的孩子
for our children.

125
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,156
但你沒有孩子  也永遠不會有
But you have no children. You can never have children.

126
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,653
我們會有的
But we will.

127
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,781
他保證我的後裔會多如繁星

128
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,417
他同我說話了  他向我承諾的

129
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,296

00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,353
你和我一起去嗎
you are with me?

133
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,360
他會指引我們去一片神奇之地

134
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,941
不行

真是神跡
Such wonder!

137
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,100
亞伯拉罕深信  他將成為一個大國之父
Driven by the belief that he will father a great nation,

138
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:10,485
他帶領自己的小部落前往上帝與他立約的新地
Abraham leads his small tribe to the land promised to him by God.

139
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,215
我還能做什麼  別的土地都被占領了
What else can I do? All the other land is taken.

140
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,135
你不能搶我的
No! You can't have mine!

141
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,467
快  快
Now! Now!

142
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,301
住手  走開
Stop! Come away!

143
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,440
不能再這樣下去了   你得告訴亞伯拉罕我們的決定
This can't go on. You've got to tell Abraham what we decided.

144
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,857
怎麼了
What's going on?

145
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,403
他的人想霸占我們的草地
His men are trying to take our pasture.

146
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,856
上帝讓我們共享這片地
God gave us this land to share.

147
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,738
那他應該再多給一些
Then he should have given us more of it.

148
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,364
告訴他
Tell him.

149
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,537
亞伯拉罕  土地不夠   我們人太多了
Abraham, there just isn't enough land. There are too many of us.

150
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,788
耶和華會給我們的  要有信心
The Lord will provide. Have faith.

151
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,370
相信看不見的上帝嗎
In a god we cannot see?

152
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,292
是時候分道揚鑣了
It's time we go our separate ways.

153
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,174
不  我們必須團結在一起
No. No, we must stay together.

154
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,176
待在一起餓死嗎
Stay and starve?

155
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,509
待在一起  眼看大家因一片草葉而自相殘殺嗎
Stay and watch our men kill each other over a blade of grass?

156
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,102
叔叔
Uncle,

157
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,729
我們打算離開
we're leaving.

158
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,902
那好吧
Very well.

159
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,158
你們想去哪裡
Where do you want to go?

160
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,113
所多瑪附近有更茂盛的草地
To the greener pastures closer to Sodom.

161
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,448
所多瑪
Sodom?

162
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,168
保重
Take care.

163
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,251
亞伯拉罕沒有自己的孩子
With no children of his own,

164
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:59,386
侄子羅得對他來說  就如同兒子一般
Abraham's nephew Lot is the closest thing he has to a son.

165
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,474
如果我連自己的家人都領導不了
How can I lead a people...

166
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,442
又如何去領導一個民族呢
when I can't even lead my own family?

167
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,183
快  幫幫他  
Quickly! Help him!

168
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,307
是羅得的人  這是雷米爾
It's one of Lot's men! It's Lemuel.

169
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,391
快   有人幫他
Hurry! Somebody help him!

170
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,190
來  靠在我身上
Here. Lean on me.

171
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,064
發生了什麼事   我們毫無勝算
What happened? We didn't stand a chance.

172
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,400
他們人太多了
There were so many of them.

173
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,406
羅得呢   還活著
And Lot? Alive.

174
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,079
但被抓走了   幫他一把
- But taken prisoner. - Help him.

175
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,954
扶著我的手  靠在我身上
Here. Take my hand. Lean on me.

176
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,751
這樣好受點
That's better.

177
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,500
好好照顧他
Tend to him.

178
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,634
我們有些精練的壯丁
We have some trained men.

179
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,262
亞伯拉罕  你們不是士兵
Abraham, you are not soldiers.

180
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,729
是我告訴他們要相信上帝  是我讓羅得跟我們一起來的  但後來他們離開了
I told them to trust in God. I made Lot come with us. And then they left us.

181
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,851
他們選擇了想要生活的地方   那是他們的決定   他們是我的家人
They had their pick of the land. It was their choice. They are family.

182
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,062
我們必須幫他們
We have to help them.

183
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,280
上帝會眷顧我們的
God will take care of us.

184
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,631
我看這個得有人幫忙制住她
What about this one, eh?

185
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,929
別碰她
Leave her alone there!

186
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,180
放開她
Let her go!

187
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,472
別碰她
Leave her alone!

188
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,444
相信上帝
Trust in God!

189
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,532
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

190
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,128
羅得
Lot.

191
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,379
羅得
Oh, Lot.

192
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,729
以寡敵眾
So few of us against so many.

193
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,604
上帝的確與我們同在
God is with us.

194
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,230
亞伯拉罕
Abraham.

195
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,563
我們還是要去所多瑪
We're carrying on to Sodom.

196
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,699
羅得  我們必須團結在一起
Lot, we must stay together.

197
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,249
不
No.

198
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,497
不  叔叔
No, Uncle.

199
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,005
我們不能回去
We can't.

200
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,254
城裡才有未來
We have to carry on.

201
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,474
我們走
Let's go.

202
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,084
亞伯拉罕
Abraham.

203
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,673
進來吧
Come inside.

204
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,255
這麼多星星
The stars.

205
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,468
-亞伯拉罕  -星星
Abraham? The stars.

206
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,553
滿天的星星
All of them.

207
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,138
來數一數   亞伯拉罕
Count them. Abraham.

208
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,770
來數數  數數
Count them. Count them.

209
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,521
我們的造物主  噓
Our Creator- Shh.

210
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,107
他創造了星星
Who made the stars,

211
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,158
也會賜給我們無數後裔
will give us as many descendants...

212
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,702
噓   噓   噓
Shh, Shh, Shh.

213
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,246
世代居住在自己的土地上
To populate our land.

214
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,288
他答應過
He has promised.

215
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,127
你會有孩子的   我不會有
You will have a child. I won't.

216
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,087
你會的   不會
You Will! I won't!

217
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,373
我不能
I can't.

218
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,506
我的年紀太大了
It's too late for me.

219
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,513
但你還是有機會的
For you, there's still a chance.

220
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,105
她
Her.

221
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,365
夏甲   那個女仆
Hagar, the servant girl.

222
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,244
不
No.

223
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,792
不  不行
No, no, no.

224
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,370
不可以
No.

225
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,720
可以的
Yes.

226
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,635
拿穩了  以實瑪利
Hold it steady, Ishmael.

227
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,194
撒拉  你看到沒
Sarah, did you see that?

228
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,738
看到沒   我的好兒子
Did you see that? Oh, my boy!

229
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,486
我的好兒子
My boy!

230
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,529
我的好兒子
「My boy.」

231
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,116
是你的好兒子
Your boy.

232
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,747
跟你媽媽去吧
Go with your mother.

233
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,436
亞伯拉罕
Abraham.

234
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,977
歡迎  我主
Welcome, Lord.

235
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,240
請進來說話吧
Please join me.

236
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,287
端水過來  為客人備好食物
Bring water. Prepare food for our visitors.

237
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,864
是  主人
Yes, master.

238
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,929
你們是遠道而來嗎
Have you travelled far?

239
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,430
是的  
Yes.

240
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,558
漫漫長路
A long WHY...

241
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,727
亞伯拉罕  你的妻子在哪兒
Abraham, where is your wife?

242
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,357
在那裡面
In there.

243
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,575
明年  撒拉會生下一個男孩
Next year, Sarah will have a son.

244
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,418
你為什麼笑
Why do you laugh?

245
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,052
-我沒有笑  -你笑了
But I did not laugh. You did.

246
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,473
誕下孩子之後
And when you have a son,

247
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,897
要給他起名叫做以撒
you will name him Isaac,

248
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,647
意為笑聲
which means 「laughter.」

249
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,203
感謝你的熱情款待
Thank you for your hospitality.

250
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,780
我們得走了
We must go.

251
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,957
路上需要我幫忙嗎
Can I help you on your way?

252
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,122
你們要去哪裡
Where are you going?

253
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:40,246
去決定所多瑪的命運
To decide the fate of Sodom.

254
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,143
滾開
Get out of here!

255
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,575
所多瑪變得墮落  
Sodom has become corrupt,

256
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,448
成了罪惡之城
a city of sin.

257
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,455
但我的侄子羅得生活在那
But my nephew Lot lives there.

258
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,331
他們全家都在那
He has a family.

259
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,459
世人對所多瑪非常不滿
The outcry against Sodom is great'.

260
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,629
那裡罪孽深重
Its sins are very grave.

261
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,100
你們要毀滅它嗎
You're going to destroy it.

262
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,850
整座城市
The whole city?

263
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,569
你是公平的上帝
You are a just God.

264
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,156
殲滅惡人的同時
Will you destroy the good men...

265
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,537
-這邊  -也要消滅那些好人嗎
- Inside. ...along with the evil ones?

266
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,204
拜托  救命
Please! Help!

267
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,130
救救我們
Help us!

268
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,583
救命
Help!

269
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,595
假若所多瑪城裡有五十個義人呢
What if there were 50 good people in Sodom?

270
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,767
他們要和那些惡人承受同樣的命運嗎
Will they suffer the same fate as the wicked?

271
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,765
請救救我們
Please help us!

272
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,471
我們會考驗他們
We will test them.

273
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:22,184
若是我的天使能在所多瑪找到五十個正直的人
If my angels find 50 righteous people in Sodom,

274
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,648
我會赦免整座城市
I will spare the whole city.

275
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,400
求求你  幫幫我們
Please. Help us.

276
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,031
-他們往這邊跑了  -救救我們
They went this way! Help us.

277
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,831
假若只有三十個呢  二十個
Or fewer. Thirty. Twenty.

278
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,749
你不會毀滅他們的  是嗎
You would not destroy them, surely.

279
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,203
-求你了  -在那邊
Please. There! Down there!

280
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,833
救救我們
Help us!

281
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,956
拜托   這邊
Please. This way.

282
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,384
如果所多瑪裡只有十個義人又如何呢
What if there were 10 righteous men in Sodom?

283
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,262
您會對他們見死不救嗎
Would you not save them?

284
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,637
羅得  你在幹嘛  他們是什麼人
Lot, what are you doing? Who are these people?

285
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,845
他們需要我們的幫助
They need our help.

286
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,851
我會盡力而為
I'll do what I can for you.

287
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,899
即使只有十個
Even if I find only 10,

288
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,943
我也會赦免整座城市
I will save the whole city.

289
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,771
-這邊  -他們可以在哪裡
This way! Where can they be?

290
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,232
-給我出來   出來
- Show yourselves! - Show yourself!

291
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,613
母親
Mother.

292
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,319
噓
Shh!

293
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,368
那是什麼
What's that?

294
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,748
他們在門後面   在那邊
They're behind the door! Over there!

295
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,002
開門  開門   他們想要什麼
- Open the door! Open the door! - What do they want?

296
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,755
羅得   把陌生人交出來
- Lot! - Give us the strangers!

297
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,224
把他們交出來
Bring them out!

298
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,513
他們是我的客人   讓我們過去
They are guests in my house. Let us pass!

299
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,762
別再糾纏不休了   我們要把你一起抓起來
Let them be! Or we'll take you too!

300
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,767
給我出來
Show yourselves!

301
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,770
Send them out!

302
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,989
讓開
Step aside.

303
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,473
-我們必須馬上離開  -我看不見了
- We must go. - I can't see!

304
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,479
快點
Come on!

305
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,445
托亞伯拉罕的福  耶和華在救你們
For Abraham's sake, the Lord is saving you.

306
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,319
繼續跑
Keep moving. That's it.

307
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,401
等等
Wait.

308
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,200
他們在那兒
There they are!

309
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,110
我們走
Let's go.

310
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,972
亞伯拉罕  要永存信念
Have faith, Abraham.

311
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,725
你們現在安全了
You are safe now.

312
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,308
你們必須離開  這座城市即將受到懲罰
You must get away. The city is being punished.

313
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,065
繼續跑   快點
Keep moving. Come on!

314
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,699
繼續跑   繼續跑   快點
Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on.

315
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,822
不可回望這座罪孽之城
Do not look back at the city of sin!

316
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,370
相信上帝
Believe in God.

317
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,823
不要回頭
Do not look back!

318
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,792
羅得
Lot.

319
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,933
快點
Come on!

320
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,726
不要回頭
Don't look back!

321
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,265
不要
No!

322
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,449
羅得之妻因違背上帝之意
Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt...

323
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,030
化為了一根鹽柱
for disobeying God.

324
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,081
羅得和他的女兒逃到山上
Lot and his daughters ?ee to the mountains,

325
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,879
從此再也無法見到亞伯拉罕
never to see Abraham again.

326
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,479
她怎麼樣了
How is she?

327
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,395
哦   哦
Oh. Oh.

328
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,104
哦
Oh!

329
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,284
是個男孩
A boy.

330
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,369
以撒
Isaac.

331
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,204
如他所應許的
As he promised.

332
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,662
哦
Ooh!

333
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,207
你們的面包
Your bread.

334
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,040
吃吧  以實瑪利
Eat your food, Ishmael.

335
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,961
以實瑪利
Ishmael.

336
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,671
這邊   快
This way! Come on!

337
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,382
我來了   快點   快點
- I am! ' Hurry! Hurry!

338
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,769
啊
Ah.

339
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,597
做得不錯
Oh, good.

340
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,711
撒拉
Sarah?

341
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,627
怎麼了
What's the matter?

342
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:29,007
那個女人以為她的兒子會承受屬於以撒的一切
That woman thinks her boy is going to inherit what rightfully belongs to Isaac.

343
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,587
這是什麼意思
What do you mean?

344
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,059
亞伯拉罕  我們一族的領導人會是誰
Who is to be the first of all our tribe, Abraham...

345
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,981
天上引領眾星的星星又會是哪一顆
the first star of all those stars in the heavens?

346
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,734
是我們的兒子
Our son...

347
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,399
還是她的兒子
or hers?

348
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,193
撒拉  我... -亞伯拉罕
Sarah, I- Abraham.

349
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,274
亞伯拉罕
Abraham!

350
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,905
你決定
You decide!

351
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,409
媽媽
Mama.

352
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,285
或者讓上帝來決定
Or let God decide.

353
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,621
勇敢一點
Be brave.

354
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,430
上帝向他保證  夏甲和以實瑪利會活下來
Assured by God that they will survive,

355
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:04,310
於是亞伯拉罕將他們送去了荒野
Abraham sends Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness.

356
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:18,657
再見了  以實瑪利
Good-bye, Ishmael.

357
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,706
我的孩子
Oh, my boy.

358
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,872
我的孩子
My boy.

359
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,624
待你長大之後
When you grow up,

360
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,707
上帝會賜予你眾多子嗣
God will bless you with many children.

361
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,162
嗯
Mmm.

362
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,165
我去給你做點早點  以撒
Let me make you some breakfast, Isaac.

363
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,746
歷經困苦歲月
After years of struggle,

364
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,925
亞伯拉罕明白了被上帝選中既是恩賜
Abraham has learned that to be chosen by God...

365
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,504
也是考驗
is a blessing and a test.

366
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,589
他必須證明他的忠誠
He must prove his faith...

367
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,721
一次又一次
again and again.

368
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,075
祭祀
A sacrifice.

369
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,705
不 
No.

370
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,334
不 
No.

371
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,587
你還不相信我的忠誠嗎
Have I not shown you enough faith?

372
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,260
以撒
Isaac.

373
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,364
多吃點
Eat up.

374
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:22,364
等你有了自己的孩子   你就會想讓他們長得高高壯壯...
When you have children of your own, you'll want them to grow up as big and...

375
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,286
亞伯拉罕
Abraham?

376
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,372
怎麼了
What's the matter?

377
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,420
上帝想要一個祭品
God wants a sacrifice.

378
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,171
我的孩子   跟我來
My boy, come with me.

379
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,129
你好
Hello.

380
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,925
父親  柴火是有了
Father, we have the firewood.

381
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,352
但是羊羔呢
But where's the lamb?

382
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,571
耶和華會准備好祭品的  孩子
The Lord will provide a sacrifice, my son.

383
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,160
亞伯拉罕來問你要羊羔了嗎
Did Abraham take a lamb?

384
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,333
沒有  夫人
No, mistress.

385
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,559
把柴火拿來
Bring the wood.

386
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,761
父親
Father?

387
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,464
你要做什麼
What are you doing?

388
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,975
父親  你弄疼我了
You're hurting me, Father.

389
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:40,355
以撒   你一定要相信上帝
Isaac, we must trust in God.

390
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,164
不  求您了
No. Please.

391
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,339
不
No.

392
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,346
求您了
Please.

393
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,851
求求您了  父親
Please, Father.

394
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,767
原諒我
Forgive me.

395
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,855
求求您了
Please.

396
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,503
亞伯拉罕
Abraham!

397
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,684
祭品
A sacrifice.

398
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,064
孩子  我的孩子   我的孩子
On, my boy, my boy, my boy...

399
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,647
不  不
No. No.

400
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,940
以撒
Isaac!

401
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,629
媽媽
Mother!

402
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,553
亞伯拉罕通過了最後的考驗
Abraham has passed the ultimate test.

403
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,428
他將成為萬國之父
He will become the father of God's nation.

404
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,349
接下來就到以撒了
Now it's up to Isaac.

405
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,228
他會有一個叫雅各的孩子
He will have a son called Jacob.

406
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,527
上帝會為他重新起名叫以色列
God will rename him Israel.

407
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,736
上帝曾對他許諾的後裔如繁星般眾多
The promise of descendants as numerous as the stars...

408
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,362
漸漸成真了
is coming true.

409
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:42,499
但不久後  飢荒迫使以色列人遠離應許之地
But famine forces the Israelites far from the promised land...

410
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,371
來到埃及
to Egypt...

411
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,252
在那裡  他們成為了法老的奴隸
Here they are enslaved by Pharaoh.

412
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,961
亞伯拉罕和上帝成了遙遠的記憶
Abraham and God become a distant memory,

413
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,472
他的子民都淪為役畜
all his people reduced to beasts of burden,

414
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,968
只有一人幸免於難
except one.

415
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,805
摩西
Moses.

416
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,936
下集《聖經故事》預告
Next time on The Bible.

417
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,063
你不能再去爭強斗勇了  我無法拒絕
- You're not going to fight again. - I can't refuse.

418
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,984
他是法老的兒子
He's Pharaohs son.

419
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,031
還手  我命令你
Fight me! I order you!

420
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,400
Yaah!

421
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,986
你根本非我族人   他在說什麼
- You're not one of us. - What's he talking about?

422
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,197
你是奴隸之子
You were born a slave.

423
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,248
你的人民就在外面  摩西   不  唉 
- Your people are out there, Moses. - No! Aaah!

424
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,078
那些以色列人   快跑
- The Israelites. - Run!

425
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,170
新生活歡迎你  摩西
Welcome to your new life, Moses!

426
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,128
你現在什麼都不是了
You are nothing now!

427
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,888
你是亞伯拉罕的神

Go! And leave my land!

441

滾出我的國土

埃及人追來了   他們追來了
The Egyptians-they're here.

耶和華
