起初
In the beginning,

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,612
上帝創造天地
God created the heavens and the earth.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,160
亞當和夏娃違背了上帝的旨意偷食了禁果
Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit.

6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:31,286
從那之後  因為該隱殺了亞伯
Since then, since Cain killed Abel,

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,869
上帝目睹了人類內心深處太多的惡念

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,957
上帝警告我  要我造一艘船

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,301
亞伯拉罕

10
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,096
上帝對我說話了
God has spoken to me.

11
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,352
他將指引我們去新的家園

12
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,685
他保證我的後裔會多如繁星

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,063
你會有孩子的   我不會有
You will have a child. I can't.

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,988
我的年紀太大了
It's too late for me.

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,194
亞伯拉罕  土地不夠   我們人太多了
Abraham, there just isn't enough land. There are too many of us.

16
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,529
是時候分道揚鑣了
It's time we go our separate ways.

17
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,285
發生了什麼事   他們人太多了
- What happened? - There were so many of them.

18
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,915
羅得呢   還活著   但被抓走了
- And Lot? - Alive. But taken prisoner.

19
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:22,342
如果我連自己的家人都領導不了  又如何去領導一個民族呢
How can I lead a people when I can't even lead my own family?

20
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,295
相信上帝
Trust in God!

21
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,926
亞伯拉罕   我們還是要去所多瑪
Abraham, we're carrying on to Sodom.

22
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,138
你們要毀滅它嗎   整座城市
You're going to destroy it. The whole city?

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:46,028
殲滅惡人的同時也要消滅那些好人嗎
Will you destroy the good men along with the evil ones?

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,118
亞伯拉罕  你的妻子在哪兒
Abraham, where is your wife?

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,250
雖然她老了  撒拉會生下一個男孩
Though she is barren, Sarah will have a son.

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,458
要給他起名叫做以撒
You will name him Isaac.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,463
上帝要你去獻祭
God wants a sacrifice.

28
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,716
你還不相信我的忠誠嗎
Have I not shown you enough faith?

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,047
亞伯拉罕
Abraham!

30
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,719
《聖經》
第02集-出埃及記

31
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,277
經過近400年的亞伯拉罕
Nearly 400 years after Abraham,

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,740
飢荒迫使以色列人遠離應許之地  來到埃及
famine has forced the Israelites from the promised land to Egypt.

33
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,745
在那裡  他們成為了法老的奴隸
Here they've been enslaved by Pharaoh.

34
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,386
亞伯拉罕和上帝成了遙遠的記憶
Abraham and God have become a distant memory.

35
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,642
他的子民都淪為役畜
All his people reduced to beasts of burden,

36
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,142
只有一人幸免於難
except one.

37
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,021
摩西
Moses.

38
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,108
你不能再去爭強斗勇了   我無法拒絕
- You're not going to fight again. - I can't refuse.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,193
母親  他是法老的兒子
He's Pharaohs son, Mother.

40
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,254
他們之間的較量必須停止
The fighting between them has to stop.

41
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,961
摩西並不想去   是你兒子逼他的  屢敗屢戰
Moses doesn't want to fight. It's your son who forces him into it and keeps losing.

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,598
也許你是我姐姐的心頭寶
You may be my sister's favourite,

43
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,183
但我才是未來的法老
but I will be Pharaoh.

44
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,110
我會是埃及的神
I will be god!

45
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,489
別打了   還手  我命令你
- Please. - Fight me! I order you!

46
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,288
摩西
Moses.

47
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,918
夠了
Enough!

48
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,375
啊
Ahh!

49
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,301
他得明白自己的身份   是你先開始的
- He needs to learn his place. - You were the one that started...

50
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,885
我是未來的法老王
I will be Pharaoh!

51
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,973
那麼你的行為處事最好有個法老王的樣子
Then you better start behaving like one.

52
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,558
都是你的錯  你就不該讓姐姐撫養他
This is your fault. You should never have let her keep him.

53
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,984
閉嘴
Silence.

54
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,936
你根本不是我族人
You're not one of us.

55
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,905
我叫你閉嘴   他在說什麼
Silence, I said! What's he talking about?

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,782
你最好現在就告訴他
You'd better tell him now.

57
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,712
你
You!

58
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,216
跟我過來
Come with me!

59
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,553
母親  告訴我什麼
Mother, tell me what?

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,722
什麼啊
What?

61
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,021
摩西   我把你當兒子一樣疼愛
Moses, I love you like a son.

62
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,742
但是你並非我親生
But you're not my blood.

63
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,164
你是奴隸之子
You were born a slave.

64
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,205
把他們都抓來
Take them all!

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,595
我父親殺了很多孩子
Father killed so many children.

66
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,099
他擔心會有叛亂
He feared a rebellion.

67
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,891
你的族人數量太多了
Your people were too many.

68
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,897
我的   人民
My... - People?

69
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,944
我救了你
I saved you.

70
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,500
你的人民就在外面  摩西
Your people are out there, Moses.

71
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,627
我們的奴隸
Our slaves.

72
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,460
那些以色列人
The Israelites.

73
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,023
你有個哥哥  叫亞倫
You had a brother- Aaron.

74
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,611
還有一個姐姐   叫米利暗
And a sister- Miriam.

75
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,782
但他們跟我們不一樣
But they are not like us.

76
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,823
快點  你  快點
Come on! You! Move along!

77
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,746
快點  快起來  婊子
Come on! You'll get more!

78
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,415
他們崇拜亞伯拉罕的神
They worship the God of Abraham.

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,709
而祂拋棄了他們
And he has deserted them.

80
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,424
起來   停
Get up! Stop.

81
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,474
以色列賤民
Israelite scum!

82
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,476
不要  求求你  我求你了
No, please! Please, I beg of you!

83
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,517
狗奴才
Dog!

84
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,629
快跑  快跑
Run. Run.

85
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,331
我會把屍體藏起來
I will hide the body.

86
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,153
主人  這是摩西的護身符
My lord, the amulet of Moses.

87
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,531
要不要追捕他   不
Shall we hunt him down? No.

88
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,417
讓他走   他已經不會造成威脅了
Let him go. He's no threat now.

89
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,503
歡迎進入你的新生活  摩西
Welcome to your new life, Moses!

90
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,754
你現在什麼都不是了
You are nothing now!

91
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,259
什麼都不是
Nothing.

92
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,711
你的子民都在外面呢  摩西
Your people are out there, Moses.

93
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,139
你非我族人
You're not one of us.

94
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,636
他們崇拜亞伯拉罕的神
They worship the God of Abraham.

95
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,018
你不應該讓她收留他
You should never have let' her keep him.

96
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,690
祂拋棄了他們
And he has deserted them.

97
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,313
我會成為法老
I will be Pharaoh!

98
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,710
摩西
Moses.

99
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,184
摩西
Moses.

100
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,786
我在這

101
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:25,046
我是亞伯拉罕  以撒和雅各的神
I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob.

102
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,048
你是真實存在的嗎   是的
You are real? I am.

103
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,973
我看到我的子民所受的痛苦
I have seen the misery of my people.

104
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,928
我派你到法老那裡去   帶他們離開埃及
I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring them out of Egypt.

105
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,139
但是我要怎麼做才能讓他們自由
But how can I set them free?

106
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,520
我現在不是一個王子
I'm not a prince now.

107
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,852
我什麼都不是
I'm nothing.

108
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,939
我會與你同在
I will be with you.

109
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,956
有了你的力量
With your power,

110
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,509
我會讓我的人民獲得自由
I will set my people free.

111
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,233
在埃及  新王已經登基
In Egypt, there is a new man on the throne.

112
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,570
摩西的老對手已經成了法老王
Moses' old rival is now Pharaoh.

113
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,001
謝謝你  父親
Thank you, Father.

114
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,426
終有一天  你會擁有一支軍隊   真正的軍隊
One day you will have an army of them. Real ones.

115
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,944
快幹活   快幹活
- Come on! - Come on!

116
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,086
一切如昨
Nothing has changed.

117
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,177
仍舊水深火熱
So much suffering. Please!

118
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,265
你   你
Hey, Wu! Hey, you!

119
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,226
回去幹活
Back to work!

120
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,730
繼續  幹活
Go on! Move it!

121
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,904
等等  請等等
Wait. Wait. Please.

122
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,903
我來跟他說  大人
I'll take care of him, master.

123
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,322
你在幹什麼  想讓我們都挨打嗎
What are you doing? Trying to get us all a beating?

124
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,454
你是誰
Who are you?

125
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,920
你在這幹什麼   我是摩西
What are you doing here? My name is Moses.

126
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,919
摩西
Moses.

127
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,175
你就是摩西
You are Moses?

128
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,929
我要見你們的長老
I need to see your elders.

129
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,351
跟我來
Come with me.

130
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,414
這人說他是摩西
This man says he's Moses!

131
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,504
那個逃跑的王子
The Runaway Prince.

132
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,797
你因犯謀殺罪被通緝
You're wanted for murder.

133
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,630
如果你真是他  為什麼回來
If you're who you say you are, why would you return?

134
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,261
上帝派我回來的
God has sent me.

135
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,685
我到這兒來
I am here

136
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,984
給你們自由
to set you free.

137
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,229
上帝派你來的
God has sent you?

138
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,030
沒錯
Yes. God...

139
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,484
上帝派我來  向你們傳話
sent me to speak to you.

140
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,787
你們還記得上帝嗎
Have you forgotten God?

141
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,621
即使你們忘記了他
Even if you have...

142
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,629
他卻未曾忘記你們
He has not forgotten you.

143
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,548
恐怕你忘記了
In case you had forgotten,

144
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,548
法老才是我們唯一讓我們害怕的神
Pharaoh is the only god we have to fear.

145
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,096
你認為他會輕易放我們走嗎
And you think he's just going to let us go?

146
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,014
是誰創造了大地
Who created the earth,

147
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,221
海洋
sea,

148
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,679
天空
the sky?

149
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,515
是誰創造了你們
Who created you?

150
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,150
法老王
Pharaoh?

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,112
還是上帝
Or God?

152
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,407
你瘋了  不
You're demented. No.

153
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,902
他沒有
He isn't.

154
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,788
他是我的弟弟
He's my brother

155
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,373
亞倫
Aaron.

156
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,876
摩西
Moses!

157
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,638
上帝向我托夢
God sent me a dream...

158
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,591
說你會回來
to say you would return.

159
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,223
這是米利暗  你的姐姐
This is Miriam, your sister.

160
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,684
弟弟
Brother.

161
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,607
這是我的孩子
My children.

162
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,661
我的家人
My family.

163
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,239
我的子民
My people

164
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,495
我們的子民
Our people.

165
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,546
-上帝的子民  -上帝的子民
- God's people! - God's people!

166
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,002
老法老王或許喜歡你
Old Pharaoh may have been fond of you,

167
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,715
但你現在要對付的是他的兒子
But it's his son you'll have to deal with now.

168
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,551
法老為什麼要見你
Why would Pharaoh even see you?

169
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,557
Oh.

170
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,067
他會想見我的
He'll want to see me.

171
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,208
你有兒子
You have a son.

172
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,504
有繼承人了  
An heir.

173
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,629
我們的王朝將千秋萬代
Our dynasty will last forever.

174
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,636
你到這兒來做什麼  摩西
Why are you here, Moses?

175
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,144
來請求寬恕嗎
Have you come to ask for forgiveness?

176
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,520
不  
No.

177
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,775
上帝出於某種目的救了我
God saved me for a purpose.

178
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,855
是嗎
Yes?

179
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:52,698
我是來要求你還他的子民自由的
I come to demand that you release his people from slavery.

180
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,164
要求
Demand?

181
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,500
讓我的子民離開
Let my people go.

182
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,296
你一直是名鬥士  摩西
You always were a fighter, Moses.

183
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,596
但你戰敗時從不自知
But you never knew when you were beaten.

184
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,765
倘若藐視上帝
If you defy God,

185
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,968
你會受到懲罰
you will be punished.

186
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,646
這麼多年後  你回來就為了威脅我嗎
You return, after all these years, to threaten me?

187
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:25,818
告訴我  是你那看不見的上帝要懲罰我嗎
Tell me. Is it your invisible God that's going to punish me?

188
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,274
那個拋棄他子民
The one who abandons his people?

189
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,576
逃避責任
The one who runs from his responsibilities?

190
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,243
逃避過去
From his past?

191
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,993
逃避家人的上帝
From his family?

192
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,877
告訴他們誰才是上帝
Teach them who God is.

193
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,210
我就是上帝
I am God!

194
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,252
我就是上帝
I am God!

195
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,318
摩西
Moses.

196
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:13,527
你惹怒了法老  他會懲罰我們的  懸崖勒馬吧
You've made Pharaoh angry. He will punish us. Don't make it worse.

197
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:19,209
上帝和我說過  倘若別無他法  他會迫使法老
God has spoken to me. He will force Pharaoh to free us.

198
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,787
還我們自由的
If he has to.

199
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,416
我們該怎麼辦  姐姐  哥哥
What should we do? Sister, Brother,

200
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,501
你們所有人
All of you.

201
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,211
相信上帝
Trust in God!

202
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,672
法老就在那兒
Pharaoh is over there.

203
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,760
你在殿上面見他的時候  他都充耳不聞  現在又怎麼會聽你的呢
If he didn't listen to you when you were six feet away, why would he hear you now?

204
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,472
到時候就知道了
You will see.

205
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,818
把你的木杖放進河裡
Put your staff to the water.

206
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,194
快  主人
Come, master!

207
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,656
快上來  血
Come out of the water! It's blood!

208
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,460
有血
It's blood!

209
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,457
到處都是血 
It's blood everywhere!

210
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,413
血流成河了
The whole river!

211
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,006
主人
Master!

212
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,426
你不是上帝
You are not a god.

213
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,678
你只是凡人
You are just a man.

214
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,642
你一定會釋放我的子民
And you will set my people free.

215
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,437
走開
Move away!

216
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,988
摩西
Master.

217
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,363
摩西
Moses!

218
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,924
你相信了嗎  約書亞
Do you doubt, Joshua?

219
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:38,757
我這一生都被法老奴役
All my life, I have been Pharaohs.

220
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,846
我再也不會是個奴隸了
I will never be a slave again.

221
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,893
上帝與我們同在
God is with us.

222
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,440
這只是個開始
This is just the beginning.

223
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,072
上帝安排了十次災難來改變法老的想法
Our Lord is sending 10 plagues to change Pharaohs mind.

224
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,073
釋放我的子民
Let my people go.

225
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,075
不
No!

226
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,872
不
No!

227
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,804
不
No!

228
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,270
蝗蟲
Locusts.

229
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,144
快離開那  主人
Come away! Master!

230
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,725
不
No!

231
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:56,418
摩西  法老怎麼說  他應該醒悟過來了吧
Moses, what is Pharaohs answer? Surely he will see sense now.

232
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,049
不
No.

233
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,847
他還是不願意  還是這樣
He refuses. Again?

234
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,301
放棄吧  摩西  不然一切都來不及了
Give up, Moses, before it's too late.

235
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:10,140
災難不會停止的   除非法老王就範
God will keep on doing this until Pharaoh breaks.

236
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,780
怎麼了
What's wrong?

237
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,408
不久  最後一個瘟疫就會發生
Soon there will be a final plague.

238
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,871
死亡天使會降臨
The Angel of Death is coming.

239
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,291
所有長子都會死
Every first-born son will die.

240
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,663
不要啊
No.

241
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,586
不會發生在我們身上吧
But not us.

242
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,413
為什麼要懲罰我們
Why would he punish us?

243
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,419
死亡是衝著所有人來的
Death is coming for us all.

244
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,342
為什麼是我們
Why us?

245
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,475
同胞們
Friends!

246
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,346
只有我們謹遵上帝的指示
We can be spared God's vengeance,

247
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,813
才能逃過這一劫難
but only if we do exactly as he tells us.

248
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,532
別灑了
Don't spill.

249
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,111
每家每戶都要用血做記號
Every single house must be marked with blood.

250
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,869
以色列人拿羊血在門上做記號
The Israelites paint'lamb is blood on their doorways,

251
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,918
以表明自己是上帝的子民
identifying them as God's people.

252
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,921
上帝保佑我們
God will watch over us.

253
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,640
我們答應上帝要拯救我們的子民
We promised God would free our people.

254
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,221
但上帝卻送來了死亡
But now he sends us death.

255
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,436
我們必須相信他
We must trust in him.

256
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,165
來了
It's coming.

257
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,918
我們會有事嗎  -別怕  孩子
Will we be safe? Don't be afraid, my son.

258
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,550
父親   上帝保佑
Father, I'm-God have mercy.

259
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,603
法老王一意孤行
Pharaoh has not listened.

260
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,851
現在他的子民要替他承受這一切苦果
Whatever happens to his people is now on his head.

261
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,529
曾經我把他們視為我的同胞  約書亞
Once I counted them as my people, Joshua.

262
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,608
我們的自由是有代價的
Our freedom comes at a price.

263
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,233
死亡天使
The Angel of Death...

264
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,442
發現每戶以色列人家都用鮮血做了標記
finds every Israelite house painted with blood...

265
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,327
就放過了他們
and passes over.

266
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,741
為什麼
Why?

267
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,910
為什麼
Why?

268
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,370
為什麼以色列奴隸還活著
Why should Israelite slaves have life...

269
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,049
而我兒子卻死了
when my son is dead?

270
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,931
起來
Get up.

271
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,851
起來
Get up.

272
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,649
滾  帶著你們那卑鄙的上帝
Go! And leave my land!

273
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,726
滾出我的國土
And take your wretched God with you!

274
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,622
東西都裝好  準備走了
Pack up. Get ready.

275
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,954
快來  走吧
Come on. Good.

276
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,090
摩西
Moses!

277
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,545
摩西  摩西
Moses! Moses!

278
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,598
你贏了
You won!

279
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,231
摩西
Moses!

280
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,899
他們做到了
They did it!

281
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:24,079
我們要去完成亞伯拉罕與上帝的聖約
We are going to fulfil Abraham's covenant with God.

282
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,165
去應許之地繁衍生息
We're going to live in the promised land...

283
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,798
擁有如繁星之多的後裔
with descendants as numerous as the stars.

284
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,409
我的孩子
My son.

285
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,425
奴隸怎可如此殘忍
How could slaves do this?

286
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,937
我在此向你發誓
I vow to you, here and now,

287
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,234
我會把以色列人抓回來
that I will bring the Israelites back...

288
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,314
讓他們為你建造世界上最宏偉的陵墓
and make them build you the greatest tomb the world has ever seen.

289
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,375
用摩西的屍體
Moses' body...

290
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,498
給陵墓奠基  給你陪葬
shall be buried in its foundations.

291
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,251
我還是不敢相信法老就這麼放了我們
I still can't believe Pharaoh just let us leave.

292
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,836
他的確這樣做了  -這是上帝的旨意
But he did. It's what God demanded.

293
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,711
經過這麼多事  只有瘋子才會再次觸怒上帝
Only a madman would defy God again after what he's done.

294
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,227
弟弟  接下來怎麼辦
Brother, what now?

295
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,346
弟弟
Brother?

296
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,397
上帝會指引我們
God will provide a way.

297
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,853
摩西  為什麼帶我們來這
Moses, why have you brought us here?

298
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,232
是上帝帶我們來的
God brought us here.

299
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,324
那上帝有沒有說怎麼過去
And what does God say about getting across?

300
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,932
埃及人  在山上
Egyptians. On the hill.

301
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,606
你的上帝現在在哪啊  摩西
Where is your God now, Moses?

302
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,312
追到他們了  他們被困了
We have them! They're trapped!

303
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,982
在那裡
There!

304
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,818
摩西
Moses!

305
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,697
戰車
Chariots!

306
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,828
他們追來了
They're here.

307
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,580
埃及人追來了
The Egyptians.

308
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,421
傻瓜  現在怎麼辦啊
Fool! What do we do now?

309
00:31:55,497 --> 00:32:00,048
是不是因為埃及沒我們的葬身之地  所以你帶我們來這送死
Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us here to die?

310
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,550
看看你幹的好事
Because that is what you've done.

311
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,633
他們來了  怎麼辦  我們去哪裡
They're coming! What do we do? Where shall we go?

312
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,217
怎麼辦
Well?

313
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,728
摩西
Moses.

314
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,853
駕  駕  駕
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

315
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,944
把東西都放到車上
Get everything into the carts!

316
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,319
我的孩子
My children!

317
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,202
摩西  -摩西
Moses! Moses! Moses!

318
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,455
等待
Wait!

319
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,386
耶和華  我不相信這是你給我們安排的結局
Lord, I cannot believe this is the end you planned for us.

320
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,854
我們看著你降災給我們的仇敵
We have watched you bring terror on our enemies.

321
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,450
在那裡
There!

322
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,574
將死亡隔絕在我們的門外
You kept death from our door.

323
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,928
摩西  摩西  摩西
Moses! Moses! Moses!

324
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,606
主啊
Lord!

325
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,895
上帝與我們同在
God is with us!

326
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,354
跟我走
Follow me!

327
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,739
上帝與我們同在   我們從這直接過去
- God is with us! - We're gonna go straight through there.

328
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,163
把大家集中到一起
Get your men together!

329
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,163
快點  快點  咱們得馬上離開
- Hurry! Hurry! - We have to leave now!

330
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,872
快點燃火炬
Light torches! Quickly!

331
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,462
快跑  快跑
Let's go! Move it! Let's go!

332
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,921
快點  快點
Quickly! Hurry!

333
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,722
快點
Come on!

334
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,892
要有信心
Have faith!

335
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,736
快點
Come on!

336
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,536
別停下
Keep moving!

337
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,613
快
Hurry!

338
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,204
別怕  要有信心
Don't be afraid! Have faith!

339
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,498
快跑
Come on!

340
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,926
快跑   別停下來
Come on! Keep going!

341
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,553
等等
Wait!

342
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,395
給我追
After them!

343
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,034
快
NOW!

344
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,410
給我活捉摩西
Bring me Moses!

345
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,255
快跑
Run!

346
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,052
摩西  快跑
Moses! Come on!

347
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,179
接著跑
Keep moving!

348
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,635
快點
Hurry!

349
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,774
我看到他們的火炬了
I see their torches!

350
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:30,280
快跑  別停下
Come on! Keep moving!

351
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,371
嗯
On!

352
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,128
他們來了 
They're coming.

353
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,587
他們來了
They're coming!

354
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,349
快點
Hurry!

355
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,525
快跑
Run!

356
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,231
快啊
Hurry!

357
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,191
馬上就要到了
We're there!

358
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,487
加油
Come on!

359
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,117
加油   老爸
Come on, old man!

360
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,395
快點
Hurry!

361
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,808
我們到了
We're here!

362
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,151
他們還在追
They're still coming!

363
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,246
在那裡  那裡
There! Up there!

364
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,251
我們已經要抓到他們了
We've got them!

365
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,427
法老  你不是神
You are not a god, Pharaoh.

366
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,268
世上只有一位上帝
There is only one God.

367
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,225
而他在這裡
And he is here...

368
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,106
與我們同在
with us.

369
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,588
不
No!

370
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,261
摩西
Moses.

371
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,969
摩西
Moses!

372
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,241
自由了
Freedom!

373
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,619
朋友們
My friends!

374
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,867
我的…子民
MY... - people.

375
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,424
上帝讓我們擺脫了奴役
God has delivered us from slavery.

376
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,175
我們自由了
We are free.

377
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,011
你們已經歷了漫長的跋涉  我知道
You have come a long way, I know.

378
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,688
但我們的旅途才剛剛開始
But our journey is just beginning.

379
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,355
我們必須相信上帝
We must trust in God.

380
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,981
追隨他的腳步
We must follow his path.

381
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:16,107
摩西領導以色列人來到了西奈山
Moses leads the Israelites to Mount Sinai...

382
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,437
在這裡  上帝在燃燒的荊棘中第一次與他對話
where God first spoke to him in the burning bush.

383
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,007
上帝將刻在石頭上的法典
God gives laws to Moses...

384
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,585
賜予了摩西
written in stone.

385
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,886
這就是《十誡》
The Ten Commandments.

386
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,437
約書亞
Joshua.

387
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,027
上帝
God has...

388
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,659
重申了他對亞伯拉罕許下的承諾
Renewed the promise he made to Abraham.

389
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:02,297
我們有了可以在應許之地實行的新法典 
We have new laws preparing us for the promised land.

390
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:08,257
如果我們忠於上帝  他一定會遵守諾言
If we are true to God, he will keep his promise.

391
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,213
亞伯拉罕的夢想
Abraham's dream.

392
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,887
我們的未來
Our future.

393
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,810
你是我們人民的未來  約書亞
You are our people's future, Joshua.

394
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:21,767
你必須延續上帝對亞伯拉罕所立
You must take the land promised to Abraham...

395
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,227
和他如繁星般多的後裔
and all of his descendants,

396
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,152
所立的約
as numerous as the stars.

397
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,080
下集《聖經》預告
Next time on The Bible.

398
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,049
耶和華帶我們離開了埃及
The Lord brought us out from Egypt.

399
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,469
他承諾將賜予我們這塊土地
He promised us this land.

400
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,673
很快  它就會是我們的了
Soon, it will be ours.

401
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,257
我們必須攻下耶利哥
We must take Jericho.

402
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,762
找一條能讓我進去的路
Just find me a way in.

403
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,558
約書亞
Joshua!

404
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,311
他們知道上帝與我們同在  都陷入恐慌  不戰自潰
The people melt in fear because they know he is with us.

405
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,233
上帝與我們同在
God is with us.

406
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,863
耶和華為摩西將海水分開
The Lord parted the waters for Moses.

407
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:12,067
而為你  他將讓岩石碎裂
For you, he will split rock.

408
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,948
耶利哥是我們的
Jericho is ours!

409
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,713
如果我們聽從上帝的指引
If we obey the Lord,

410
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,837
一切皆有可能
anything is possible!

411
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,293
以色列
Israel!

412
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,550
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

413
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,766
上帝會允你一個兒子
God will give you a son.

414
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,929
你的力量源自上帝
Your strength comes from God.

415
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,185
參孫
Samson,

416
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:47,861
"你背負著趕走非利士人的使命"
your duty is to drive the Philistines away.

417
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,063
您想讓我怎麼辦
What would you have me do?

418
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,696
拋棄我愛的女人  就因為她是非利士人嗎
Reject the woman I fell in love with just because she's a Philistine?

419
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,574
我們得給以色列人點顏色瞧瞧  我們的女人不是他們可以染指的
We need to send these Israelites a message. They cannot take our women.

420
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,408
為吾妻
For my wife.

421
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,963
你叫什麼名字
What is your name?

422
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,720
我叫大利拉
My name is Delilah.

423
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,051
你為何如此強壯
Why are you so strong?

424
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,020
上帝與我同在  大利拉
God is with me, Delilah.

425
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,600
他賜我神力
He makes me strong.

426
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,402
倘若我剪了頭髮
If I cut my hair,

427
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,605
上帝會收回我的神力
my God will take away all my strength.

428
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,199
你做了什麼
What have you done!

429
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,527
每個人都有自己的價碼
Everyone has their price.

430
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,956
你的上帝拋棄了你
Your God has deserted you...

431
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,831
收回了你的神力
and taken your strength with him.

432
