《聖經》前情提要
Previously on The Bible.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,527
起初
In the beginning,

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,109
上帝創造天地
God created heaven and earth.

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,531
然而人罪惡令他失望
Then human failings led him to destroy his creation.

6
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,083
錯誤的選擇,錯誤的決定
Wrong choices, wrong decisions.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,378
從諾亞後，開始了一個新時代...
After Noah, a new beginning...

8
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,127
和一個亞伯拉罕的承諾
and a promise for Abraham.

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,879
上帝同我說話了
God has spoken to me.

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,633
他將指引我們去新的家園
He will lead us to a new home.

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,341
他保證我的後裔會多如繁星
He has promised descendants as numerous as the stars.

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,017
但由埃及奴役，亞伯拉罕的後裔遭受了痛苦
But enslaved by Egypt, Abraham's descendants suffered...

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,568
直到一個新的領袖出現
Until a new leader emerged...

14
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,896
誰會成為以色列最偉大的英雄

15
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,856
你是誰
Who are you?

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:07,068
我是摩西
My name is Moses.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,371
上帝派我回來  給你們自由
God has sent me... to set you free.

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,746
自由  他們能自由選擇成為奴隸還是死人
Freedom? They're free to choose...

19
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,702
被奴役或是死亡
slavery or death!

20
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,664
我這一生都被法老奴役
All my life, I have been Pharaoh 's.

21
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,083
我再也不會是個奴隸了
I will never be a slave again.

22

跟我走
Follow me!

26
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,400
上帝讓我們擺脫了奴役
God has delivered us from slavery.

27
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,656
去應許之地繁衍生息
We're going to live in the promised land.

28
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,244
亞伯拉罕的夢想  我們的未來
Abraham's dream is our future.

29
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,953
你是我們人民的未來  約書亞
You are our future now, Joshua.

30
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,835
你必須延續上帝與亞伯拉罕子孫的夢想
You must take the land promised to Abraham.

31
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,915
摩西帶領以色列人
Moses has led the Israelites...

32
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,422
到應許之地的邊垂
to the edge of the promised land.

33
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,880
在約書亞帶領下,他們要征服它
Under Joshua, they must conquer it.

34
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:14,357
《聖經》
第03集-家園

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,981
耶和華   摩西傳下這十誡時
Lord, I was with Moses...

36
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,186
我和他在一起
when he handed down these commandments.

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,145
我見證了這份聖約
I was witness to the covenant,

38
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,732
見證了賜予我們聖潔國度的承諾
the promise of a holy nation.

39
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,988
助我建立這個國度
Help me to forge that nation,

40
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,918
領導你的子民繼承他們的土地
to lead your people to inherit their land.

41
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,916
約書亞
Joshua!

42
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,348
主帶我們離開了埃及
- The Lord brought us out from Egypt. - Right!

43
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,303
他承諾將賜予我們這片土地
He promised us this land.

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,432
很快
And soon,

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,523
就會是我們的了

46
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,607
過來
Come.

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,077
你們準備好了嗎  -我們會搜查整個城市
- Are you ready? - We'll search the whole city.

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,999
找一條能讓我進去的路
Just find me a way in.

49
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,794
我們必須攻下耶利哥
We must take Jericho.

50
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:26,590
這是我們與應許之地間唯一的障礙了
It's all that stands between us and the promised land.

51
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,450
嘿   嘿
Hey. Hey!

52
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,581
白天才能取水
You can only collect water in daylight.

53
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,628
現在回家去  走  走

以色列人隨時可能進攻

56
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,895
喇合  我的小妓女

00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,445
你在外頭做什麼   你知道這是不安全的
What are you doing out, hmm? You know it's not safe.

58
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,862
挺安全的
Safe enough.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,984
沒有人是安全的
No one is safe.

60
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,034
我可以照顧自己

00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,628
回去吧
Go home.

64
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,234
出去  出去

以色列人  救命

66
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,200
以色列人

67
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,128
哥哥

為了以色列

快
Quick.

71
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,161
這邊  再來點人
Over here! Get more men!

72
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,077
我們得躲進去  小心
We've got to get inside. Look out.

73
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,464
決不能讓他們跑了
They must not escape.

74
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,420
挨家挨戶搜
Go door to door.

75
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,218
進去
In here.

76
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,055
所有人  都回家去
Everyone, return to your homes.

77
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,111
人呢
Hello?

79
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,779
安靜  我保證不會傷害他
Keep quiet, and I promise I won't hurt him.

80
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,159
你發誓
Swear.

81
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,620
是的
Mmm.

82
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,727
-你們是以色列人  -你聽說過我們嗎
- You're Israelites.- You've heard about us?

83
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,522
你們有個能呼風喚雨  分開眾海的神
You have a god who commands the winds and parts the seas.

84
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,775
他讓我們擺脫奴役  
He saved us from slavery.

85
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,318
我們是被他選中的子民
We are his chosen.

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,521
這座城裡的百姓忌憚你們
This whole city is terrified of you.

87
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,733
你們有如此神通廣大的神   我們怎麼可能打敗你們
How can we fight a people whose god can do that?

88
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,692
開門  開門
Open up! Open up!

89
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,455
-進去  -把門打開
Back inside. Open the door!

90
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,659
這條路能出去嗎
Can we get out that way?

91
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,913
幫幫我們  我們也會幫你的
Help us, and we will help you.

92
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,791
走吧
Go.

93
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,547
我會盡力拖延的
I'll stall them if I can.

94
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,845
打開門
Open the door!

95
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,262
跟我們一起走吧 
Come with us.

96
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,515
不行  我還有家人
I can't. My family.

97
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,987
我們軍隊攻進來的時候   把這個掛你在門上
When our army comes, hang this on your door...

98
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,736
這樣他們就不會傷害你們
so they will know not to harm you.

99
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,740
你將免於這場災禍
You'll be passed over.

100
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,827
待在這兒
Stay here.

101
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,126
約書亞
Joshua!

102
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,053
告訴我  找到進城的方法了嗎   這突破口嗎
Tell me, did you find a way in? Is there a weakness?

103
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,555
城牆上沒有
Not in the walls...

104
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,228
但百姓心中有
but... in their hearts.

105
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,397
約書亞  我們遇到一個女人
Joshua, we met a woman.

106
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,351
她認為這座城已經被上帝拿下了
She thinks God has taken the city already.

107
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,187
他們知道上帝與我們同在   都陷入恐慌  不戰自潰
The people melt in fear because they know he is with us.

108
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,318
上帝確實與我們同在
God is with us.

109
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,449
但我們仍要想辦法進城
But we've still to find a way in.

110
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,682
摩西
Moses,

111
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,475
我的老朋友
my old friend,

112
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,684
你接下來會怎麼做
what would you do?

113
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,164
主啊  當我還是奴隸的時候
Lord, when I was a slave,

114
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,457
你向我展現了你的愛與能力
you showed me your love and your power.

115
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,000
你給了我新的生活
You have given me new life.

116
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,005
現在你想讓我們回頭嗎
Would you have us turn back?

117
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,976
你
Who...

118
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,724
你是誰
Who are you?

119
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,810
我祈禱你是幫助我們的
I pray you are with us...

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,691
不是幫助我們敵人的
and not with our enemies.

121
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,235
我是與神同在的
I am with God.

122
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,153
耶和華軍隊的元帥
Commander of the Lord's army.

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,910
我主有什麼話吩咐僕人
What does he ask of us?

124
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,712
主為摩西把紅海分開
The Lord parted the waters for Moses.

125
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,544
為你
For you...

126
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,359
主將塌陷城牆
He will split rock.

127
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,734
你必須這麼做
This is what you must do.

128
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,901
你們的一切兵丁要圍繞這城   一日圍繞一次
March around the city once a day with all the armed men.

129
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,205
六日都要這樣行
Do this for six days.

130
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,326
抬著約櫃
Carry the Ark with you.

131
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,209
裡面有神的戒律   這樣祂就與你同在
It contains God's commandments, and he is with you.

132
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,795
第七日
Then, on the seventh day,

133
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,302
你們要繞城七次
march around the city seven times.

134
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,522
祭司也要吹角
Then the priests should make a long blast' with a ram is horn.

135
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,444
你們一聽見角聲
As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet...

136
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,278
眾百姓要大聲呼喊
All the people shall shout a great shout.

137
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,837
他們來了
It's happening!

138
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,086
榮耀將會降臨
Glory will come.

139
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,024
他的確是這世界的造物主
He truly is the shaper of the world.

140
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,272
我們要把這座城獻給主
We give this city to the Lord!

141
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,224
耶利哥是我們的
Jericho is ours!

142
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,171
只有妓女喇合與她家中所有的可以存活
Only Rahab the prostitute and her family may be spared,

143
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,963
這是上帝的旨意
for God said she must be spared...

144
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,883
因為她幫助了我們   因為她幫助了我們
- for the help she gave us. ...for the help she gave us.

145
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,576
上帝
God...

146
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,574
兌現了他的承諾
has kept his promise.

147
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,407
只要我們遵從主
If we obey the Lord,

148
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:31,129
萬事都可能
anything is possible!

149
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,549
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

150
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,628
以色列  以色列
Israel. Israel.

151
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:43,717
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

152
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,900
約書亞死後一百年
A hundred years after Joshua,

153
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:57,321
以色列十二個部落遍布迦南
the 12 tribes of Israel have spread out across the promised land.

154
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,947
嘿
Hyah!

155
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,120
但他們四面楚歌
But hostile neighbours surround them.

156
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,579
嘿   嘿
Hyah! Hyah!

157
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,537
非利士人武器精良  訓練有素
Better armed and better trained,

158
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,587
是以色列人最致命的威脅
the Philistines are the deadliest threat.

159
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,672
由於缺少摩西和約書亞這樣傑出領袖的領導
Without great leaders like Moses or Joshua to unite them,

160
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:28,138
以色列人必須倚仗被稱為"士師"的本土英雄
the Israelites must rely on local heroes called judges...

161
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,854
參孫就是其中之一
people like Samson.

162
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,320
母親  來
Mother, come.

163
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,066
這種日子什麼時候才能到個頭啊
When will this all stop?

164
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,520
我也不知道
I don't know.

165
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,272
你必須反抗
You must fight them.

166
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,610
那是上帝想讓你做的  參孫
It's what God wants you to do, Samson.

167
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,195
那是上帝創造你的原因
It's why God created you.

168
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,450
記住他的信使跟我說的話
Remember what his messenger told me.

169
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,556
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

170
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,387
雖然你不能生育  但上帝會允你一個兒子
Though you are barren, God will give you a son.

171
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,724
感謝您
Thank you.

172
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,434
不過仔細聽好了
Listen carefully.

173
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,236
這是有條件的
There are conditions.

174
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,822
你當謹記  不可飲酒
See to it that you drink no alcohol...

175
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,199
不可吃不潔之物
and eat nothing unclean.

176
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,530
兒子出生後
And when your son is born,

177
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,493
他永遠不可剃頭
his hair must never be cut.

178
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,546
這是他作為拿細耳人的標記
This will be the sign that the boy is a Nazarite.

179
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:24,129
他自出生起  便歸上帝
He is given to God, from his birth to his death.

180
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:29,091
他會從非利士人手中拯救以色列
He will begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines.

181
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,358
你的力量源自上帝
Your strength comes from God.

182
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:53,286
你背負著趕走非利士人的使命
Your duty is to drive the Philistines away.

183
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,629
參孫沒有對抗非利士人
Instead of fighting the Philistines,

184
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,888
反而愛上了一個非利士女子  並娶她為妻
Samson falls in love... and marries one.

185
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,365
讓我和她談談  -當然
Let me talk to her. Of course.

186
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,360
嗯
Mmm.

187
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,913
母親
Mother,

188
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,541
難道愛不是源自上帝嗎
does love not come from God?

189
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,917
您想讓我怎麼辦
What would you have me do...

190
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,624
拋棄我愛的女人
reject the woman I fell in love with...

191
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,630
就因為她是非利士人嗎
just because she's a Philistine?

192
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,464
你的愛能保護我們不被他們傷害嗎
Will your love protect us from them?

193
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,722
參孫  參孫   參孫  參孫   參孫  參孫 
Samson! Samson! Samson! Samson! Samson! Samson!

194
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,724
參孫  參孫  參孫
Samson! Samson! Samson!

195
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,518
我們得給以色列人點顏色瞧瞧
We need to send these Israelites a message,

196
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,901
讓他們明白我們的女人不是他們可以染指的
make it clear to them they cannot take our women.

197
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,278
我們兩族永遠不能通婚
Our people should never mix.

198
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,580
要怎麼抓住他
How are we going to get to him?

199
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,165
不用抓  他
We're not going to get... to him.

200
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:23,041
開門
Open up!

201
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,135
參孫在哪兒  -我不知道
Where is Samson? I-l don't know.

202
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,878
他在哪兒  -他不在這裡
Where is he? He's not here.

203
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,259
父親  父親  不要
Father! Father! No!

204
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,224
父親  不要  
Father! No!

205
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,972
不要啊
No!

206
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,055
動手  -求你們了  不要這樣
- Do it. - Please, no.

207
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,266
你是我們民族的恥辱
You are a disgrace to our people.

208
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,145
求求你  -我求你  求你了
Oh, please. Please. Please, I beg you!

209
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,521
別碰她
Don't hurt her.

210
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,652
父親  不要
Father! No!

211
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,234
不  不要
No. No.

212
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,993
不  不要
No. No!

213
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,204
求求你
Please.

214
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,035
求求你  求你們了  別這樣
Please, I'm begging you no.

215
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,041
求你們了  不要啊
Please, no.

216
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,384
不要
No!

217
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,059
不  不要
No! No!

218
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,219
不要
No!

219
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,854
為吾妻
For my wife.

220
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,302
非利士人
Philistines!

221
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,964
快來  -救救我們
Over here! Help us.

222
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,137
救命
Help us!

223
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,904
放了我們  放了我們
Free us. Free us!

224
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,539
抓住那個以色列人
Stop the Israelite!

225
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,395
只有一個人有這種能耐
One man did this.

226
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,856
他在哪兒  他的族人一定知道
Where is he? His people must know.

227
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,943
你
You!

228
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,829
你把參孫找來見我
You will bring Samson to me,

229
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,282
馬上把他找來
and you will do it quickly.

230
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:09,040
我一天不見到他   就殺一個以色列人
And for every day I do not see him, one of you will die...

231
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,588
即刻生效
starting now.

232
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,594
不  不  不要  求你了
No, no. No, no, please.

233
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,141
求你了  別
Please, no!

234
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,689
參孫
Samson!

235
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,691
參孫
Samson!

236
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,449
參孫
Samson!

237
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,867
參孫
Samson.

238
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,133
參孫
Samson?

239
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,512
參孫
Samson.

240
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,098
你在嗎
Are you there?

241
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,977
母親
Mother.

242
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,407
我沒想到您會來  請寬恕我
I wasn't expecting you. Forgive me.

243
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:28,457
我們是來勸你的  參孫   -勸？
- We have come to reason with you, Samson. - Reason?

244
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,126
你必須停止殺非利士人
You must stop the killing.

245
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,748
求你了
Please.

246
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,172
你殺了那麼多非利士人
For every Philistine you kill,

247
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,750
現在有兩個非利士人來找我們報仇了
two more appear, seeking revenge.

248
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,007
我只是以其人之道還治其人之身
As they did to me, so I have done to them.

249
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,259
如今非利士人是我們的統治者
The Philistines are our rulers now.

250
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,263
每個人都應該做他們認為對的事
Everyone must do what they think is right.

251
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,094
不  參孫
No, Samson.

252
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,023
你必須為你的人民  為上帝
You must do what is right for your people.

253
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,521
做正確的事
For God.

254
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,987
而不是為你自己
Not for yourself.

255
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,320
你必須犧牲自己  參孫
You must give yourself up, Samson.

256
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:16,376
母親  這是上帝的旨意嗎
Mother, is this what God wants?

257
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,584
我不確定
I'm not sure.

258
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:28,886
有時候   上帝在冥冥之中領導我們
Sometimes God leads us in ways we cannot see.

259
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,063
上帝會指引你的選擇
God will guide your choices.

260
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,255
來
Come.

261
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,893
讓開
Stand aside.

262
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,478
退後
Stand back.

263
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,189
退後
Get back.

264
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,608
退開
Stay back.

265
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,910
你得到你的戰利品了
You have your prize.

266
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:33,207
我看到的是一個不過是個殺人犯
All I see is a common murderer.

267
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,205
你也好不到哪去
No worse than you.

268
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,206
為什麼要殺我的妻子
Why did you kill my wife?

269
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,384
為了給你
To teach you...

270
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,461
和你的族人一個教訓
and your people a lesson.

271
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,136
為拯救族人我願犧牲自己
I gave myself up to save my people.

272
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,061
現在你願意放了他們嗎
Will you leave them alone now?

273
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,357
如果我有更多的人手   我會把你們通通趕回
If I had more men, I'd drive you all...

274
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,561
屬於你們的荒蕪之地
back into the wilderness where you belong.

275
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,365
痛快地殺個片甲不留
I'd happily kill all of you.

276
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:19,995
殺了他
Kill him.

277
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,425
你背負著趕走非利士人的使命
Your duty is to drive the Philistines away.

278
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,723
上帝會引導你
God will guide your choices.

279
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:37,055
我的耶和華神  是你嗎
My Lord God of Israel, is that you?

280
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,631
主啊
Lord,

281
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,551
這是你希望我做的嗎
is this what you want from me?

282
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,688
請引領我
Guide me, please.

283
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,577
過來
Come.

284
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,955
過來
Come!

285
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,640
謝謝你
Thank you.

286
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,353
你叫什麼名字
What is your name?

287
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,486
我叫大利拉
My name is Delilah.

288
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,513
大袞[非利士人的神]
Dagon,

289
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,518
上帝  造物者  我們的神
god and creator, lord of our land,

290
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,684
請將參孫  我們的敵人
deliver into our hands...

291
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,938
我們民族的破壞者
our enemy, Samson,

292
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,325
交予我們手中
destroyer of our nation.

293
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,736
我們有參孫的消息了
We have news of Samson.

294
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,537
他找了個新女人
He's got a new woman.

295
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,707
一名非利士女子
A Philistine woman.

296
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,836
又一個
Another one?

297
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,458
她叫什麼名字
What's her name?

298
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,040
大利拉
Delilah.

299
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,502
我認識她
I know her.

300
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,884
帶她來見我
Bring her to me.

301
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,358
大利拉
Delilah,

302
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,910
感謝你能前來
thank you for coming.

303
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,625
你還是如此誘人
As beguiling as ever.

304
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,176
你想怎麼樣
What do you want?

305
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:41,473
讓我們聊聊吧   你選擇了參孫
Well, let's just have a little talk- about Samson.

306
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,391
真是稀奇
An interesting choice.

307
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:49,190
一個外族男人   為什麼要和他一起
Not one of us, of course. Why are you with him?

308
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,141
為什麼你想要知道
Why do you want to know?

309
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,522
別告訴我你關心他
Don't tell me you care about him.

310
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,320
你們倆墜入愛河了嗎
Is he in love with you?

311
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,523
你自己去問他
Ask him yourself.

312
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,155
他屠殺了我們成百上千個的族人
He's butchered hundreds of our people.

313
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,735
他變了
He's changed.

314
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,492
自從遇到我後  他已改過自新
He's a different man since he's met me.

315
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,198
你真的相信嗎
You really believe that?

316
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:11,629
他會繼續殺戮   直到我們找到辦法除掉他
He will go on killing until we find a way to stop him for good.

317
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,542
他的力量從何而來
Where does he get his strength?

318
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,093
他的秘密是什麼
What's his secret?

319
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,593
我不知道   他不會告訴我的
I don't know. He won't tell me.

320
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,298
試著說服他
Try to convince him.

321
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,010
你難道沒見識過他的能耐
Have you seen what he's capable of?

322
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,438
或許這個會有所幫助
Maybe this will help.

323
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,899
這是你的危險額外津貼
Call it danger money.

324
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,651
全都是你的
It's all for you.

325
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,501
但不是現在
Uh-uh. Not now.

326
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,379
等到我們知道了他的秘密才是
Not until we know his secret.

327
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
你為何如此強壯
Why are you so strong?

328
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,020
上帝與我同在  大利拉
God is with me, Delilah.

329
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,570
他賜我神力
He makes me strong.

330
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,495
"上帝與你同在"是什麼意思
What do you mean.'God is with you'?

331
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,077
他如何賜你神力
How does he make you strong?

332
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,038
我母親無法生育
My mother was barren.

333
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,543
上帝給了她一個孩子   我
God brought her a child- me.

334
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,346
但有些事情是我不能做的
But there are things I must not do.

335
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,590
比如說
Such as?

336
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,017
我從不剪我的頭髮
I have never cut my hair.

337
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,187
這是被禁止的
I am forbidden.

338
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,435
這代表著我對神的忠誠委身
A sign of my devotion.

339
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,064
倘若我剪了頭髮  我
If I cut my hair, I...

340
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,817
怎麼樣  親愛的
What, my love?

341
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,194
倘若你剪了頭髮會怎麼樣
What if you cut your hair?

342
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,619
上帝會收回我的神力
My God will take away all my strength.

343
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,534
我會變得同凡人一樣羸弱
I will be as weak as everyone else.

344
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,600
你不相信我嗎
You don't believe me?

345
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,265
不  參孫
No, Samson,

346
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,942
我相信
I do.

347
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,079
參孫
Samson!

348
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,250
哇 啊
Wha- Huh?

349
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,248
抓住他
Take him.

350
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,050
怎麼...
What...

351
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,504
你做了什麼
Wha- What have you done?

352
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,156
別自責
Don't feel bad.

353
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,664
不過就是你被賣了
Everyone has their price.

354
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,160
大利拉
Delilah.

355
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,260
仔細看看
Take a good look...

356
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:32,511
要記住你跟大利拉相遇的那天
and remember the day you first met the lovely Delilah.

357
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,430
你再也見不到她了
You will never see her again.

358
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,451
把他帶走
Take him away.

359
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,334
走   走
Move. Move!

360
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,419
快點
Quickly.

361
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,723
帶他過去
Bring him through.

362
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,440
失明的以色列人
Blind Israelite!

363
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,030
我站不住了
I am weak.

364
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,956
讓我靠著什麼吧
Stand me against something.

365
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,954
主啊
Lord...

366
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,789
安靜
Quiet!

367
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,629
主啊
Lord,

368
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,632
如果我是你選召的人  別放棄我
if I am yours, remember me now.

369
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,347
讓能我再次擁有力量
Strengthen me once more.

370
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:04,023
你的上帝已經拋棄你了  參孫
Your god has abandoned you, Samson.

371
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,899
是你使我雙目失明的
You are the man who took away my eyes.

372
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,994
我很高興
I am glad of it,

373
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,322
因為幽暗幫助我思考
for the darkness helps me think.

374
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,534
你的上帝拋棄了你
Your god has deserted you...

375
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:26,745
收回了你的神力
and taken your strength with him.

376
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,876
不...
No.

377
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,585
我現在能更清楚地看到他
I can see him more clearly than ever.

378
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:39,262
他讓我徹底毀了你們
He wants me to destroy you all!

379
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,557
結束了  參孫
It's over, Samson.

380
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,536
阻止他
Stop him!

381
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,126
殺了他
Kill him!

382
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,375
快
- Now!

383
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,199
參孫的犧牲也同時終結了數千非利士人的性命
Samson's sacrifice kills thousands,

384
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,244
但他再也無法單槍匹馬地反抗非利士人了
but he could never defeat the Philistines on his own.

385
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:12,119
先知撒母耳動員以色列人以上帝之名團結一致
The prophet Samuel has urged the people to unite in Gods name.

386
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,545
上帝至高無上
There is no one like the Lord.

387
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,879
但經過了數十年的努力
But after decades of struggle,

388
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:21,837
他還是沒能阻止非利士人的入侵
he, too, has failed to halt the Philistines.

389
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,799
先知  我們在等你
Prophet, we await you.

390
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,352
人們的耐心日漸喪失
And the people's patience is wearing thin.

391
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,318
你們有什麼煩惱
So what is it that troubles you?

392
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,155
我們很感激您  先知
We are grateful, prophet.

393
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,954
您已領導我們多年
You have led us for many years.

394
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,206
是上帝領導我們
God has led us.

395
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,162
撒母耳
Samuel,

396
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,543
但您年齡漸長
you are not as young as you were.

397
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,042
我們很憂心
We are worried.

398
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,512
在您之後  誰來和上帝說話
Who will speak to the Lord after you?

399
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,056
誰會領導我們對抗非利士人
Who will lead us against the Philistines?

400
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,054
我的兒子們會繼承
My sons will inherit my place.

401
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,430
您的兒子們都腐敗無能
Your sons are corrupt.

402
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:17,984
我的兒子們從小就信仰上帝  謹遵教條 
My sons have been brought up to trust in God and obey his laws.

403
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,860
我為你們做的每件事   都是因為我行上帝之道
Everything I have done for you I have done because I walk in God's ways.

404
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,192
我們知道他們收受賄賂
We know that they take bribes.

405
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,867
人盡皆知
Everyone knows it.

406
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,071
他們敗壞了您的名聲
They shame your good name.

407
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,578
所以
So,

408
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,962
當您不在
when you are gone...

409
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,710
非利士人卷土重來
and the Philistines return...

410
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,168
我們能指望您的兒子們  呼求上帝時
and we look to your sons to call on God,

411
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,795
上帝會回應嗎
will God answer?

412
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,596
不  不會
No. He will not.

413
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,928
那你們想怎麼樣
Then what do you want?

414
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,479
一位王
A king.

415
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,183
就像其他國家一樣
As other nations have.

416
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,395
但看看那些國家的王都幹了什麼
But look what other nations' kings do.

417
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,946
他們變成暴君  奴役自己的子民
They become tyrants. They make slaves of their people.

418
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,946
由上帝選中的王不會這樣
Not if they are chosen by God,

419
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,116
再由正直的先知為其膏立
anointed by his righteous prophet...

420
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,947
就是您
by You.

421
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,420
你是要違抗上帝嗎
You would reject our God?

422
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,168
上帝給予我們這片土地
God promised us this land.

423
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,045
這是上帝的國度
This is God's kingdom.

424
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,047
他是唯一的王
He is our only king.

425
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,300
您是上帝之耳  撒母耳
You have the ear of the Lord, Samuel.

426
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,844
您必須請求他為我們選一位王
You must ask him to choose a king for us.

427
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,441
你們都出去  所有人都出去
Leave me alone. All of you.

428
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,612
我曾奉獻所有
I have given everything.

429
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,158
現在他們不願聽從我的領導
Now they have rejected me...

430
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,487
上帝
and you, God.

431
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,291
如果您想讓我為他們找一位王
But if you say I should give them a king,

432
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,164
我當然會這樣做
then of course I will.

433
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,669
但誰能擔此重任呢
But who should it be?

434
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,644
我明白了
I see...

435
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,990
那不可能是我
that could never be me.

436
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,917
但我仍然是你的先知
But I will still be your prophet.

437
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,376
我可以指導你的王
I can guide your king.

438
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,755
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

439
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,713
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

440
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:57,723
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

441
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,190
掃羅
Saul.

442
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:12,822
願你能依循上帝的律法
May you reign justly and wisely...

443
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,403
公正且有智慧治理這地
and according to God's law.

444
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:23,874
我膏你作以色列的第一位王
I anoint you the first king of Israel.

445
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,384
我想，作為神的先知
May I, as God's prophet,

446
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,261
我可以盡我所能幫助你
help you in any way I can.

447
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,355
在以色列歷史上開始了一個新時代
A new era in Israelite history is beginning...

448
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,106
掃羅  掃羅   先知和君王的時代
- Saul! Saul! - The period of prophets and kings.

449
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:53,693
他們必須共同努力，以確保應許之地
They must work together to secure the promised land.

450
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,994
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

451
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,037
下集《聖經》預告
Next time on The Bible.

452
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,749
都準備好了
Are the men ready?

453
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,542
他們準備好了
They're ready.

454
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,791
我們必須在我們開戰前獻祭
We must make a sacrifice before we attack.

455
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,540
願上帝饒恕你
May God forgive you!

456
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,547
好好當你的王。 把獻祭的事交給我
Be a king. Leave the job of priest to me.

457
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:16,132
你雖是我們的先知  但我是你的王
You are our prophet, but I am your king!

458
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,468
上帝所給的，祂隨時可以收回
What the Lord gives, he can take away.

459
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,144
上帝與我同在
God is with me!

460
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,315
你和他在一起  我王  是嗎
Are you with him, Lord, really?

461
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,391
你悖逆了耶和華
You disobeyed the Lord.

462
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,105
他必將你的王國  給大衛
He has torn your kingdom from you and given it to David.

463
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:35,109
輪到你當王了   你難道不會剪除我的後裔？   不會讓我臭名？
When you have my crown, will you not kill my descendants, bury my name?

464
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,786
耶路撒冷  我們的新家園
Jerusalem, our new home.

465
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,583
王永遠不可能超越上帝
A king is never above his god.

466
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,661
你濫用你的權力
You abused your power.

467
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,623
你奪走了你最忠誠的僕人烏利亞的一切
You took everything from your most loyal servant.

468
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,084
你奪人妻子  然後又害死了他
You took his wife, then you took his life.

469
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,262
你以為上帝對此一無所知嗎
You think God doesn't see everything?

470
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,054
我是他所選召的
I am his chosen one.

471
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,508
大衛   由於你蔑視上帝
David, he will bring disaster on your house.

472
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,218
必有災禍臨到你家
We shall see.
