00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,517
《聖經》前情提要
Previously on The Bible.

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,896
人為的過失導致了大洪水
Human failings led to the great flood.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,443
錯誤的選擇   錯誤的決定
Wrong choices, wrong decisions.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,568
諾亞後，一個新的開始
After Noah, a new beginning...

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,275
和給亞伯拉罕的應許
and a promise for Abraham.

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,235
上帝對我說話我了
God has spoken to me.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,788
他將帶領我們到一個新的家園
He will lead us to a new home.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,868
他應許要給我如天上繁星般多的後裔
He has promised descendants as numerous as the stars.

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,795
幫助以色列人實現應許
To help the Israelites fulfil the promise,

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,170
上帝差遣摩西 使他們擺脫奴役
God sent Moses to free them from slavery.

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,001
主
Lord!

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,723
約書亞帶領他們進入應許之地
Joshua led them into the promised land.

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,098
耶利哥是我們的
Jericho is ours!

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,350
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,148
但以色列人面臨著來自
But the Israelites faced brutal opposition...

17
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,692
非利士人殘酷的抵抗
from the Philistines.

18
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,659
即使有些人敢於抵抗
Some dared to fight back.

19
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,962
但甚至參孫也不可能戰勝他們
But not even Samson could overcome them.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,762
先知撒母耳動員以色列人以上帝之名團結一致
The prophet Samuel led the Israelites in God's name,

21
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,260
但人們希望更多的人
but the people wanted more...

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,512
來帶領他們的戰鬥
someone to lead them in battle.

23
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,265
那你們想怎麼樣   一位王
- What do you want? - A king.

24
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,142
王  這些王總變成暴君
A king? They become tyrants.

25
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,349
由上帝選中的王不會這樣
Not if they are chosen by God.

26
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:44,735
掃羅  我膏你作以色列的第一位王
Saul, I anoint you the first king of Israel.

27
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,443
我想，作為神的先知
May I, as God's prophet,

28
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,199
我可以盡我所能幫助你
help you in any way I can.

29
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:56,375
但誰夠好來治理上帝的國度？
But is any man good enough to rule God's kingdom?

30
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,751
《聖經》
第04集-國度

31
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,472
都準備好了？
Are the men ready?

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,890
他們準備好了
They're ready.

33
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,349
撒母耳在哪裡
Where is Samuel?

34
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,430
他應該在這裡
He should be here.

35
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,609
我們必須在我們開戰前獻祭
We must make a sacrifice before we attack.

36
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,111
我們不能再等了
We cannot wait any longer.

37
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,291
掃羅  願上帝饒恕你
Saul! May God forgive you!

38
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,039
撒母耳
Samuel.

39
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,585
你在這幾天在哪裡
Where were you?

40
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,915
我們已經等待了七天   七天
Seven days we have waited. Seven days.

41
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,499
我的人都要放棄了
My men are deserting.

42
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,382
好好當你的王。 把獻祭的事交給我
Then be a king. Leave the job of priest to me.

43
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,305
你認為神喜歡你這樣越權獻祭嗎？
Do you think God values your sacrifice more than mine?

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,883
撒母耳
Samuel.

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,594
上帝命令你們
God instructs you...

46
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,440
殺滅萬事萬物
kill everyone and everything

47
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,369
在以色列歷史上開始了一個新時代
A new era in Israelite history is beginning...

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,702
先知和君王的時代
the period of prophets and kings.

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,792
他們必須共同努力，以保護應許之地
They must work together to secure the promised land.

50
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,141
拿起武器
To arms!

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,874
勝利
Victory!

52
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,047
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

53
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,131
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

54
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,057
上帝與我同在
God is with me!

55
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,223
上帝與我同在
God is with me!

56
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,062
你只有一項任務
You had one task,

57
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,189
上帝的一道簡單命令
one simple command from God.

58
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,898
摧毀一切  -我們已遵從了他的命令
- Destroy everything. - We followed his commands.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,608
我聽到的這些羊叫聲又是怎麼回事
Then what is this bleating of goats in my ears?

60
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,286
牛群的低哞和羊羔的慟哭又是什麼
What is this lowing of cattle and wailing of lambs?

61
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,285
死的東西會哭嗎
Can the dead cry out?

62
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,458
這位異教徒王又是誰
And who is this pagan king?

63
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:46,457
過會兒就處死他
He is to be put to death later.

64
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,790
主說寬恕  你便可寬恕
When the Lord says spare, you spare.

65
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,921
主說殺
When he says kill...

66
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,712
撒母耳
Samuel!

67
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,305
你雖是我們的先知  但我是你的王
You are our prophet, but I am your king.

68
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,354
上帝所給的，祂隨時可以收回
What the Lord gives, he can take away.

69
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,306
這是上帝說的還是你說的
Are these God's words or yours?

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,394
你的後裔本可以統治逾千年
Your descendants could have ruled for over a thousand years.

71
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,148
但今天
But today,

72
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,234
上帝已經拋棄你了
God has forsaken you.

73
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,324
上帝還說了什麼
More divine words?

74
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,453
上帝已收回你的能力
God has torn your power from you.

75
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,756
他想找一個合他心意的人
He wants a man after his own heart

76
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,070
給我倒酒  -是的陛下
Bring me wine. Sire.

77
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,784
聽到沒有  快點
Do you hear me? Now!

78
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,361
是  陛下
Yes, sire!

79
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,533
也許是我太不耐煩了
Perhaps I have been hasty.

80
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,537
我應該祈求撒母耳的原諒
I should ask Samuel's forgiveness.

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,717
把撒母耳帶來見我
Bring Samuel to me.

82
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,794
他走了  陛下
He's gone, Majesty.

83
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,839
走了
Gone?

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,895
撒母耳
Samuel!

85
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,918
掃羅觸怒了上帝
After Saul's disobedience,

86
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,213
而今上帝指引先知撒母耳
God commands his prophet Samuel...

87
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,382
尋找一位新的王
to find a new king.

88
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,182
年輕人
Young man!

89
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,695
你叫什麼名字
What is your name?

90
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,988
大衛  先生
David, sir.

91
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,193
我叫大衛
My name is David.

92
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,424
我膏立於你  伯利恆的大衛
I anoint you, David of Bethlehem,

93
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,511
在掃羅死後
to be the next king of Israel...

94
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,972
繼任以色列王
once Saul is dead.

95
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,321
父親  怎麼了
Father, what's wrong?

96
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,737
告訴我怎麼了
Tell me what's wrong.

97
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,831
沒事
Nothing is wrong.

98
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,704
這是一場偉大的勝利
It was a great victory.

99
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,754
我需要休息  僅此而已
I need rest. That is all.

100
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,342
睡吧  睡吧
Sleep. Sleep.

101
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,887
主啊  寬恕你的僕人吧
Lord, forgive your servant!

102
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,679
後來
In time,

103
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,016
大衛成了掃羅的朝前侍從
David becomes an attendant in Saul's court...

104
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,436
一位奉侍王室的 預備王儲
a king in waiting.

105
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:57,333
非利士人的威脅持續增強
The Philistine threat continues to grow.

106
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,794
現在他們有了一個新的勇士
Now they have a new champion...

107
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,966
歌利亞
Goliath.

108
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,363
你們誰敢出來與我作戰
Will one of you fight me?

109
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,942
以色列人  你們贏了
Israelites, you win,

110
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,495
非利士人就做你們的奴隸
and the Philistines will be your slaves.

111
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,197
我贏了
I win,

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,282
你們
and you...

113
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,333
就做我們的奴隸
will be our slaves.

114
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,954
總得有人跟他作戰  -你退下  約拿單
Someone must fight him! Not you, Jonathan.

115
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,502
戰勝他的勇士將獲萬貫家財
The warrior who defeats him will be a rich man.

116
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,631
一個以色列人都不敢 
Not one man in Israel?

117
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,179
"上帝的子民" 一個都不敢出來迎戰嗎
Not one of God's people.

118
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,018
我來
I'll do it.

119
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,692
大衛
David.

120
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,020
你不是士兵  你是牧羊人
You're no soldier. You're a shepherd.

121
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,276
是的  牧羊人
Yes, a shepherd.

122
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,115
正如我保護我的羊一樣  上帝也會保護我
As I protect my sheep, God will protect me.

123
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,162
你們的信心在哪裡
Where is your faith?

124
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,741
你們的上帝在哪裡
Where is your god?

125
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,869
我會殺了他
I will kill him.

126
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,712
帶上這個
You'll need this.

127
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,353
沒有這個更好
I'll be better without it.

128
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,900
我雖然行過死陰的幽谷
Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death,

129
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,948
也不怕遭害
I fear no evil...

130
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,864
只因你與我同在
for you are with me.

131
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,445
你的杖  你的竿
Thy rod and staff,

132
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,573
都安慰我
they comfort me.

133
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,622
你用油膏了我的頭
You anoint my head with oil.

134
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,712
使我的福杯滿溢
My cup over?ows.

135
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,625
我一生一世必有恩惠慈愛
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me...

136
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,761
隨著我
all the days of my life.

137
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,245
看來以色列找到一位勇士了
Israel has found a champion.

138
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,793
別浪費我時間  小伙子
Don't waste my time, little boy.

139
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,921
你現在死還太年輕了
You're too young to die.

140
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,093
我要和你戰鬥
I will fight you.

141
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,332
父親  他成功了  大衛成功了
Father, he did it. David did it.

142
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,140
去抓奴隸吧
Let us make slaves of them!

143
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,443
大衛
David!

144
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,613
勇猛的牧羊英雄
My wolf in shepherd's clothing.

145
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,950
你挽救了我的王國  牧羊人勇士
You've saved my kingdom, my shepherd warrior!

146
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,243
跟我來  兄弟
Come with me, brother.

147
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,391
大衛加入了掃羅的軍隊
David joins Saul's army...

148
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,139
與非利士人打了幾十年的仗
and battles the Philistines for decades.

149
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,068
他成了一名勇士
He becomes a warrior,

150
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,195
一位領袖
a leader,

151
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,529
一個英雄
a hero.

152
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,993
掃羅  掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

153
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,828
掃羅  掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

154
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,755
掃羅殺敵數千
Saul has killed thousands!

155
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,677
掃羅  掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

156
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,129
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul!

157
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,964
掃羅  掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

158
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,347
你聽到了嗎  父親
You hear that, Father?

159
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,052
我聽到了
I hear.

160
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,853
掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul!

161
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,523
掃羅  掃羅  掃羅
Saul! Saul! Saul!

162
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,029
大衛殺敵萬萬
David has killed tens of thousands!

163
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,696
大衛  大衛
David! David!

164
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,027
大衛  大衛
David! David!

165
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,953
大衛  大衛   大衛
David! David! David!

166
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,416
大衛  大衛   他理應得到他們的贊譽
David! David! He deserves their praise.

167
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,789
接下來他就該覬覦我的王位了
He'll want my crown next.

168
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,920
大衛  大衛
David! David!

169
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,223
我以為你當時摔下馬了
I thought you were going to fall off your horse.

170
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,972
是摔下了馬
I did fall off my horse.

171
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,053
我摔下來的時候還壓死了一個人
I think I killed a man when I landed on him.

172
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,764
一度我看見兩個男人站在我面前
There was one point there were two men in front of me.

173
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,145
大衛
David.

174
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,647
過來
Come here.

175
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,662
所以..
So,

176
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,543
你又一次成了我們的英雄
once again, you are our champion.

177
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,831
你殺敵數千
You have killed thousands.

178
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,791
數萬呢
Tens of thousands.

179
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,922
當然
Of course.

180
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,844
數萬人
Tens of thousands.

181
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,183
我們的人民都非常感激你
Our people are very grateful to you.

182
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,308
上帝保佑我們所有人
The Lord blessed us all.

183
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,819
我要獎賞你
I would like to reward you.

184
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,541
我把我的女兒米甲許配給你
I offer you my daughter, Michal.

185
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,208
我深感榮幸  陛下
I'm very honoured, Majesty.

186
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,217
大衛  我們現在是兄弟了
David, we're brothers now.

187
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,847
作為回報
In return...

188
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,898
我要一百條非利士人的性命
100 dead Philistines.

189
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,068
你怎麼看
Hmm? What say you?

190
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,489
一百個非利士人  由你手刃
100 dead Philistines slain by your own hand.

191
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,066
父親
Father,

192
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,326
他以身犯險的還不夠嗎
he's risked his life enough, no?

193
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,244
如果他回不來怎麼辦
What if he doesn't return?

194
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,823
我會回來的
I shall return.

195
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,536
如上果帝許可
God willing.

196
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,119
你愛他如親兄弟一般吧
You love him like a brother, don't you?

197
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,496
是啊
I do.

198
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,121
就像亞伯曾經愛戴該隱一樣
As Abel, no doubt, once loved Cain.

199
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,666
他覬覦我們的王位
He wants our crown.

200
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,791
你看不出來嗎   不
Can't you see? No.

201
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,794
他忠於我們   胡說
He's loyal to us both. Nonsense!

202
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,819
給您帶了點紀念品
A few mementos for you.

203
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,117
還有這些
And these.

204
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,947
從每具屍體上拿回來的戰利品
Trophies taken from each of their bodies.

205
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,496
一百具屍體嗎
From a hundred men?

206
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,423
兩百具
200.

207
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,667
上帝與我同在
God was with me.

208
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,170
米甲
Michal.

209
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,641
我們走吧
Let's go.

210
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,676
出去   所有人
Get out, all of you.

211
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,420
滾出去
Get out!

212
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,976
父親
Father.

213
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,026
是什麼魔鬼蒙蔽了你
What demons possess you?

214
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,230
如果不是因為他   我們都會變成奴隸
If it wasn't for him, we would all be slaves...

215
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,315
你也不會繼續當王
and you would not be king.

216
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,026
但有了他  你永遠不會成為王
And with him, you never will be.

217
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,794
你父親  也就是王  想見大衛
Your father, the king,wishes to see David.

218
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,089
不行  他現在...身體不適
He can't. He's... not well.

219
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,096
身體不適
Not well!

220
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,763
你是說"身體不適"嗎
Not well, you say.

221
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,688
我們來瞧瞧  來瞧瞧
Well- Well, we shall see.

222
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,765
來瞧瞧
We shall see.

223
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,272
身體不適
Not well.

224
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,938
大衛
David?

225
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,025
好啊
Yes.

226
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,037
幹得好啊
Yes.

227
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,117
你幫他逃跑了
You have helped him escape.

228
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,496
比起你父親的王位  你更在意自己的後位   不
You would rather be queen than see your own father king! No!

229
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,797
你背叛了自己的兄長
You would betray your own brother!

230
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,295
父親  您需要休息
Father, you need to rest!

231
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,676
連我的親生孩子都算計我
So... even my own children plot against me!

232
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,598
大衛
David!

233
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:25,643
不論你逃到何方  我都饒不了你
Wherever you go, I shall hunt you down!

234
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,426
祭司
Priests!

235
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,226
你們的王有話要問你
Your king wishes to speak with you.

236
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,689
出來  -快出來
- Come here! Out! - Come on!

237
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,653
大衛曾來過  對不對
David was here, wasn't he?

238
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,409
你們為他提供了庇護   這裡是聖殿
You sheltered him. This is God's house.

239
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,541
我們為所有上帝的子民提供庇護
We offer shelter to all his people.

240
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,757
殺了他
Kill him.

241
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,383
我說殺了他
I said kill him!

242
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,015
全部殺掉
Kill all of them.

243
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,932
我忠心地侍奉您  耶和華
I have served you faithfully, Lord.

244
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,265
盡我所能  全心全意
As faithfully as a man can.

245
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,143
但如今看來  似乎依然不夠
And yet still it seems it is not enough.

246
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,815
永遠不夠
Not enough.

247
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,233
上帝與我同在
God is with me!

248
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,277
上帝與我同在
God is with me!

249
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,780
主啊
Lord!

250
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,119
您聽見你的僕人嗎？
Do you hear your servant?

251
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,634
陛下
Majesty...

252
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,512
大衛
David.

253
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,683
我並未傷害過您  您為何對我窮追不舍
Why do you pursue me when I have done you no harm?

254
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,518
我剛剛本可以殺了你
I could have killed you.

255
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,893
取你性命  易如反掌
Your life was mine to take.

256
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,023
那你為何沒有下手
Why didn't you take it then?

257
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,446
主自會懲罰你對我犯下的罪孽
The Lord may revenge the harm you have done to me,

258
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,523
但惡事出於惡人
but only evildoers do evil deeds.

259
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,406
我卻不加害於你
So my hand will not touch you. Ever.

260
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,034
可是上帝會賞賜你  你將成為王
And God will reward you,and you will be king!

261
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,328
您才是我的王   輪到你當王了   
You are my king. And when you have my crown,

262
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,160
你難道不會剪除我的後裔？   不會讓我臭名？
will you not kill my descendants, bury my name?

263
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,628
我不會   不會嗎
I will not. No?

264
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,546
我發誓
I swear.

265
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,542
不會嗎
No?

266
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,919
那你過來
Come then.

267
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,095
過來
Come.

268
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,054
我們一起回家
We'll go home together.

269
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,911
你當時為何不趁機殺了他
Why did you not kill him when you had the chance?

270
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,044
因為他也是受膏者之一
Because he's one of the anointed.

271
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,087
唯有上帝才能決定他的命運
It's up to God to decide his destiny.

272
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,716
父親
Father!

273
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:10,718
父親
Father!

274
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,893
父親
Father.

275
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,434
父親
Father.

276
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,359
非利士軍隊駐扎在基利波附近的山谷
The Philistine army is in the next valley, near Gilboa.

277
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,984
約拿單  大衛可能會暗算我們
Jonathan, David is very near.

278
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,941
別再想大衛了
Forget about David.

279
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,369
你必須保衛自己的王國
You must defend your kingdom.

280
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,617
這是你的職責
That is your duty.

281
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,036
你說得對
You're right.

282
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,339
我們必須備戰
We must prepare for battle.

283
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,635
告訴軍隊  我們要朝基利波進發
Tell the men we leave for Gilboa.

284
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,929
破曉就出發
Tell them we leave at dawn.

285
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,686
約拿單  別管我了
Jonathan, save yourself!

286
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,488
不  我們要並肩作戰
No! We stand together!

287
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,034
父親  快走  快走
Father, come on! Come on!

288
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,876
拉弓
Draw!

289
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,005
約拿單
Jonathan!

290
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,800
約拿單
Jonathan!

291
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,345
約拿單   約拿單
Jonathan. Jonathan.

292
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,022
不  我兒
Oh, my son!

293
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,897
不  為什麼
Oh, why?

294
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,424
親愛的主啊
Dear God.

295
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,762
是否因我罪孽深重
Were my sins so great...

296
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,885
所以整個以色列都要受苦受難
all of Israel must suffer?

297
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,853
駕  駕
Hyah! Hyah!

298
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,404
非利士人
A crushing victory...

299
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,950
大獲全勝
for the Philistines.

300
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,458
掃羅呢
And Saul?

301
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,301
死了
Dead.

302
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,272
你認為上帝的受膏者身亡不值一提嗎
You think the death of God's anointed is a trivial thing?

303
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,649
約拿單呢
What of Jonathan?

304
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,608
被俘了嗎
Captured?

305
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,943
殺了他
Get rid of him!

306
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,547
一代偉人竟這般逝去
How are the mighty fallen.

307
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,641
我們可以回家
We can go home.

308
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,604
現在人民只能指望你了
The people will look to you now...

309
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,315
抵御外敵  凝聚人心
to defend them, unite them.

310
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,738
是時候了
Our time has come.

311
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,588
是的  我的陛下
Yes, my king.

312
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,845
大衛王
King David.

313
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,433
大衛召集了追隨者
David gathers followers.

314
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,562
但想團結以色列百姓  還需城池來建都
But to unite Israel, he needs a capital city.

315
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,940
耶路撒冷
Jerusalem.

316
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,862
我們的新家園
Our new home.

317
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,233
只要想出辦法進城就可以了
Now we just need to find a way in.

318
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,115
如何進城
How do we do that?

319
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,906
只有一個法子
There is one way.

320
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,785
等待夜幕的降臨
We wait till nightfall.

321
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,763
現在怎麼辦
What do we do now?

322
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,145
拿著
Here.

323
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,631
掃羅發生了什麼事
...what happened to Saul!

324
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,531
為了以色列
For Israel.

325
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,700
小心  -拿起武器
Look out! To arms!

326
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,295
烏利亞
Uriah!

327
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,151
以色列
Israel!

328
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,631
耶路撒冷城現在是大衛的都城了
Jerusalem is now David's city,

329
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,805
這座城市成為以色列人新的權力中心
a new center of power for the Israelites...

330
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,178
也是他們信仰上帝的終極象徵
and a home for the ultimate symbol of their bond with God.

331
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,559
約櫃
The Ark of the Covenant!

332
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,205
我的朋友  你妻子太漂亮了
Your wife's far too pretty for you, my friend.

333
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,665
沒錯
You're right.

334
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,500
陛下   來
Majesty. Come.

335
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,166
你不介意吧  烏利亞  -可我介意
You don't mind, Uriah. I mind.

336
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,551
如今上帝才真正與我同在了
Now God is truly with me.

337
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,720
陛下
Your Majesty.

338
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,261
先知
Ah. Prophet.

339
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,097
看
Look.

340
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,353
這是我獻給
My temple.

341
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,809
約櫃的聖殿
For the Ark.

342
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,519
也獻給主
For the Lord.

343
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,650
這會是世上獨一無二的聖殿
The world's never seen anything like it.

344
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,777
主昨晚降臨
The Lord came to me last night.

345
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,779
他對我們的工作很滿意吧
He's pleased with our work?

346
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,408
主示說  大衛家將永遠統治以色列
The Lord told me the House of David will rule Israel forever.

347
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,411
我們深蒙神寵
We are blessed.

348
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,118
你的兒子將續位為王
Your son will be king.

349
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,749
你的兒子會建造聖殿
Your son will build the temple.

350
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,797
我的聖殿
My temple.

351
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,126
主的聖殿
God's temple.

352
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,963
主的聖殿
God's temple.

353
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,599
永恆之國
A kingdom forever.

354
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,937
謝謝你  拿單
Thank you, Nathan.

355
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,953
陛下
Your Majesty.

356
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,332
如您所要求
As you requested.

357
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,918
退下吧
Leave us.

358
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,257
拔示巴
Bathsheba.

359
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,557
陛下
Majesty...

360
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,011
叫我大衛吧
David.

361
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,142
可有我丈夫的音訊
Is there news of my husband?

362
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,266
沒有
No.

363
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,102
不不  這並非噩耗   雖然遠在千裡之外
No, nothing like that. He's safe enough, I believe,

364
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,190
但我相信他應該平安無恙
although he is far away.

365
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,942
抵御外敵
Fighting the enemy.

366
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,577
但您卻沒有上戰場
But you didn't go.

367
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,404
我不用去
No need.

368
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,492
因為有烏利亞這樣的勇士替我去
Not with men like Uriah to do it for me.

369
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,001
我忠於我的丈夫
I am loyal to my husband.

370
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,935
那對你的王呢
What about your king?

371
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:40,777
這是不對的
This is wrong.

372
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,207
無人會知曉
No one need know.

373
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,471
後來  拔示巴懷孕了
Bathsheba becomes pregnant.

374
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:12,066
上帝選中的王違背了他的誡命
God's chosen king breaks his commandments.

375
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,237
烏利亞  我的朋友  歡迎
Uriah, my friend. Welcome.

376
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,734
您找我嗎  殿下
You sent for me, Majesty.

377
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,332
戰況如何
How's the war going?

378
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,455
挺好的  很順利
Well. Very well.

379
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,465
你的統領官約押  他一切都好嗎
And your commander, Joab, all is well with him?

380
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,417
都很好
All is well.

381
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,173
其他士兵呢
Your fellow soldiers?

382
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,254
征戰英勇
They fight well.

383
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,760
非常好
Excellent.

384
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,138
你可以明早再來向我詳細匯報
Well, you can give me a fuller report in the morning.

385
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,219
我想你現在一定很想和妻子在一起
I'm sure for now you'd rather be with your wife.

386
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,941
我不能去找我的妻子  -當然可以
I cannot stay with my wife. Of course you can.

387
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,066
可我的士兵們還駐扎在野外
While my men are camped in open country,

388
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,193
與敵人激戰
fighting the enemy?

389
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,534
這是一場聖戰
This is a holy war.

390
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,705
我怎麼可以回家  與妻子共度良宵
How could I go to my home and spend the night with my wife?

391
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,373
所以你這麼受人愛戴  烏利亞
That does you credit, Uriah.

392
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,451
但是說實在的
But, man to man,

393
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,036
誰會知道這事
who's to know?

394
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,505
我自己心知肚明
I will know.

395
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,462
正直之士啊
Good man.

396
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,306
讓我們開懷暢飲吧
Then let's drink.

397
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,096
上酒
Wine!

398
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,366
大衛無法迫使烏利亞與拔示巴同床
David cannot force Uriah to sleep with Bathsheba.

399
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,953
所以他另覓他法
So he finds another way...

400
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,164
來掩蓋通奸之事
to conceal his adultery.

401
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,729
約押將軍  我命令你派遣烏利亞
Commander Joab,I order you to send Uriah...

402
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,985
去到陣勢極險之處
to where the fighting is fiercest...

403
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,817
丟下他  令其自生自滅
and abandon him there to die.

404
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,265
我們真是福澤深厚
We've been richly blessed.

405
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,145
你以為可以掩蓋自己所做的事嗎
You think you can just sweep what you've done under the carpet?

406
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,866
你奪走了你最忠誠的僕人烏利亞的一切
You took everything from your most loyal servant, Uriah.

407
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,452
你本該敬重他才是  -我確實尊重他
He deserved your respect. I did respect him.

408
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,949
是嗎
Really?

409
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,869
你奪人妻子  然後又害死了他   先知
You took his wife, then you took his life. Prophet!

410
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,952
你以為上帝對此一無所知嗎
You think God doesn't see everything?

411
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,788
上帝已經對我說了
The Lord has spoken to me.

412
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,842
由於你蔑視上帝
He will bring disaster on your house...

413
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,465
他將讓你一家蒙受災難
for the contempt you have shown the Lord.

414
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,686
不  -不
- No. - No!

415
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,981
他將拿去你的兒子
He will take your son.

416
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,694
我們走著瞧
We shall see.

417
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,879
主啊  我願奉獻一切
Anything, Lord.

418
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,508
請饒過吾兒吧
Please spare my child.

419
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,006
請告訴我
Tell me.

420
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,682
告訴我該做什麼
Tell me what to do.

421
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,897
哦
Oh.

422
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,196
先是我丈夫  現在是我的孩子
First my husband, now my son.

423
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,871
我們被咒詛了
We are cursed.

424
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,459
但我是受膏者
But I was anointed.

425
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,336
上帝賜福於我
God blessed me.

426
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,383
王永遠不可能超越上帝
A king is never above his god.

427
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,963
你本應以祂之名治理國家  而不是為你一己私欲
You were supposed to rule in his name, not your own.

428
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,764
我們完了
We're finished.

429
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,435
所有人都會看出  上帝已經拋棄了我們
Everyone will see that God has left us.

430
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,569
先知
Prophet.

431
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,616
雖然你意志薄弱  他依然愛你  大衛
Even though you are weak, he loves you, David.

432
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,241
你在人間建立了上帝的國度
You have forged God's nation on earth.

433
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,492
相互慰藉吧
Take comfort in each other.

434
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,662
你們還會有兒子的
You will have another son.

435
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,483
小心  所羅門
Be careful, Solomon.

436
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,731
讓他玩吧
Let him play.

437
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,404
這是聖殿
It's the house of the Lord.

438
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,279
總有一天  他要建立聖殿
One day, he'll have to build it.

439
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,285
所羅門會建造聖殿
Solomon will build God's temple.

440
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,206
但如他父親一般
But like his father,

441
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,128
他會發現  遵守上帝的誡命難於登天
he will find it impossible to obey God's commandments.

442
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,916
下集《聖經》預告
Next time on The Bible.

443
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,592
尼布甲尼撒  尼布甲尼撒
Nebuchadnezzar! Nebuchadnezzar!

444
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,762
上帝將從巴比倫帶來災難
God is bringing disaster from Babylon!

445
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,339
尼布甲尼撒
Nebuchadnezzar!

446
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,924
我們前進
We move!

447
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,884
耶路撒冷
Jerusalem!

448
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:29,861
你不向上帝傳達我們需要幫助嗎
Will you not speak for us in our hour of need?

449
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,525
看看外面
Look out there.

450
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,320
為時已晚
You're too late.

451
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,111
戰爭開始了
It begins.

452
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:44,117
臣服於尼布甲尼撒王   向他跪拜
Submit to King Nebuchadnezzar. Bow your head.

453
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,845
不管耶路撒冷還剩下什麼   隨你們處置
And whatever is left of Jerusalem, help yourselves!

454
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,016
這邊走  但以理
This way, Daniel.

455
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,148
我們還會回到耶路撒冷嗎
Will we ever return to Jerusalem?

456
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,571
耶利米保證過... 終有一天我們會的
Jeremiah promised that one day we would.

457
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,740
到那時  我們該怎麼做
In the meantime, what do we do...

458
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,783
對這個暴君俯首稱臣嗎
just bow our heads and serve this monster?

459
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,407
我會讓他們臣服的
I will make them bow.

460
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,954
給我點火
Bring me fire!

461
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,498
耶和華  救我
Lord! Save me!

462
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,964
如果預言是正確的  那麼古列會釋放我們
Cyrus will set us free if the prophecy is right.

463
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,545
我不能言而無信
I cannot go back on my word.

464
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,881
我已承諾人民信仰自由
I promised them freedom to worship.

465
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,841
這只是考驗他們的忠誠而已
It is merely a test of their loyalty.

466
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,302
這是個圈套  他們想置我們於死地
It's a trap for all of us. They want us dead.

467
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,858
將來的那一位  他將用火來施洗
There is one to come who will baptise with fire.

468
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,607
我不過是曠野中的吶喊   做好準備    迎接
I'm just a voice in the wilderness,preparing the way for the...

469
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,443
主
Lord.

470
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,901
我們要做什麼
What are we gonna do?

471
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,531
改變世界
Change the world.
