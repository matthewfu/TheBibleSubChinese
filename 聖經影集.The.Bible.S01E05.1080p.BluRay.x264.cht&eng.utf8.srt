瀕臨崩潰

16
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:17,416
你崇拜的是異教的神 你污瀆了你的上帝
You worship foreign idols! You defile your God!

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,791
去城門那兒

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,493
背叛了巴比倫

尼布甲尼撒  尼布甲尼撒
Nebuchadnezzar! Nebuchadnezzar! Nebuchadnezzar!

31
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:20,052
尼布甲尼撒  尼布甲尼撒

32
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,072

這裡  耶路撒冷

你知道耶路撒冷的含義嗎

37
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,298
和平之城
「Jerusalem」? City of peace.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,093
耶路撒冷
- Jerusalem! - Hyah!

39
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,409
自大衛時期以來
Since the time of David,

40
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,617
耶利米那樣的先知們一直引導著他們的王
prophets like Jeremiah have guided their kings.

41
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,500
他們是以色列和上帝之間的直接連結
They are Israelis direct link with God.

42
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,511
但王對耶利米的警告視若無睹

43
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,507
現在他要向西底家傳遞最後的訊息
Now he delivers a final message to Zedekiah.

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,267
向尼布甲尼撒投降
Surrender to Nebuchadnezzar...

45
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,430
否則就是死
or die.

46
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,435
不忠的子民  住手
- Faithless people! - No!

47
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,866
先知  那是什麼
Prophet, what is that?

48
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,990
這是你
This is you.

49
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,913
如果你足夠明智
If you are wise,

50
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,834
就臣服於巴比倫加給你的軛
place yourself under the yoke of Babylon.

51
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,707
接受主的懲罰
Accept the Lord's retribution...

52
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,381
知道祂仍對你寬容
and know that he is being lenient with you.

53
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,052
這是上帝的旨意
These are God's words!

54
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,339
臣服於尼布甲尼撒王
Submit to King Nebuchadnezzar.

55
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,639
向他跪拜
Bow your head.

56
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,595
你怎敢讓王跪拜
You dare tell your king to bow down?

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,351
你怎敢質問上帝的先知
How dare you question a prophet of God!

58
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,899
是你冒犯了... 是你該修正態度
It's you who offends! It's you who must change!

59
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,898
瘋子

60
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,032
-把他帶走  -叛徒
Remove him. Traitor.

61
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,702
上帝將讓巴比倫帶來災難

62
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,999
耶路撒冷  耶路撒冷

65
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,052
去城門那兒
To the gates!

66
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:04,142
快  進去
Quickly! Get inside!

67
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,349
-我的兒子  -父親

68
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,604
請當心
Please be careful!

69
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,064
你們來得太晚了
You're too late! You're too late!

70
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,780
-父親  我的孩子

讓我們進去
Let us in!

74
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,022
全城都封鎖了嗎 是的  王陛下
Is the city sealed? Yes, my king.

75
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,066
沒有一個人會逃脫
No one escapes.

76
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,818
騎兵，向東前進
Cavalry, to the east!

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,082
戰爭開始了
It begins.

78
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,978
18個月後
After 18 months,

79
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,651
被圍困的以色列人彈盡糧絕
the trapped Israelites start to starve.

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,324
絕望的人們只能食人裹腹
The desperate resort to cannibalism.

81
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,287
滾開  滾開
- Get off! - Get off!

82
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,864
他是我們的
He's ours.

83
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,839
弓箭手準備
Archers ready!

84
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,811
瞄准

放
Fire!

86

把火撲滅 
- Help! - Put the fires out!

87
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,186
我和你同在
"'I am with you"

88
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,069
耶和華如是說
「So saith the Lord.」

89
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,243
先知
Prophet.

90
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:11,413
你不向上帝傳達我們需要幫助嗎
Will you not speak for us in our hour of need?

91
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,044
什麼都沒有變
Nothing has changed.

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,373
整個耶路撒冷將會被夷為平地
All Jerusalem will burn.

93
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,335
你寫的 懺悔吧  懺悔吧  一切都會好起來
You wrote, 「Repent, repent, and all will be well.

94
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,591

95
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,971
看看外面
Look out there.

96
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,392
為時已晚
You're too late.

97
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,190
現在
Now.

98
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,648
現在  就是現在

99
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,450

104
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,513
不管耶路撒冷還剩下什麼
- Pull back! - And whatever's left of Jerusalem...

105
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,850
隨你們處置
Help yourselves!

106
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,141
別傷害我的孩子
Not my child!

107
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,563
在耶路撒冷被屠城之際
As Jerusalem is destroyed,

108
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,241
西底家和他的兒子們從一條密道中逃走
Zedekiah and his sons escape through a secret passageway.

109
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,318
現在要勇敢起來
Now you must be brave for me.

110
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,205
做得到嗎
Can you do that?

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,124
別擔心  我們會沒事的
Don't worry. We'll be safe.

112
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,124
快  這邊走
Quickly. This way.

113
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,251
他的子民就沒這麼幸運了
His people are not so lucky.

114
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,333
耶路撒冷是我們的
Jerusalem is ours.

115
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,549
耶路撒冷是我們的
Jerusalem is ours.

116
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,636
這是他們反抗我的懲罰
Punish them for trying to resist me.

117
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,972
讓他們付出代價
Make them pay!

118
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,237
去聖殿
To the temple!

119
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,249
拿上所有東西  然後把這聖殿燒成平地
Take everything and burn this temple to the ground.

120
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,259
可憐
Have mercy!

121
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,188
聖殿  聖殿著火了
The temple! The temple's on fire!

122
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,614
我們為之奮鬥的一切都沒了
Everything we fought for is lost.

123
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,614
從亞伯拉罕時期開始
Since the time of Abraham,

124
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,323
猶大人為了迦南拼盡全力
the Jewish people have struggled for this promised land.

125
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,085
如今世世代代的希望和夢想都化為烏有
Now the hopes and dreams of generations are destroyed.

126
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,098
在那些為了生存而逃亡的人當中
Among those ?eeing for their lives...

127
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,144
有個叫但以理的年輕貴族
a young nobleman called Daniel.

128
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,936
這邊走  但以理  幫幫我們  上帝
This way, Daniel! Help us, Lord.

129
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,277
被鎖住了
It's locked!

130
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,447
但以理  躲到我身後
Daniel! Get behind me!

131
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,169
等等
Wait!

132
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,931
這些人看上去挺有錢的
They look valuable.

133
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,350
活捉他們  什麼?
Take them alive. What?

134
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,805
亞撒利雅  快走
- Azariah! - Move!

135
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,734
但以理
Daniel!

136
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,194
但以理
Daniel!

137
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,240
亞撒利雅  不  我們是上帝的子民
Azariah! No! We're people of God.

138
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,408
但以理  待在一起
- Daniel! - Stay together.

139
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,820
亞撒利雅 
Azariah!

140
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,788
尼布甲尼撒  尼布甲尼撒
Nebuchadnezzar! Nebuchadnezzar!

141
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:08,463
尼布甲尼撒  尼布甲尼撒
Nebuchadnezzar! Nebuchadnezzar!

142
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,257
找到西底家
Find Zedekiah.

143
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,464
找到他的家人  是  陛下
- Find his family. - Yes, sir.

144
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,552
這就是背叛的代價
There's a price for betrayal.

145
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,405
別擔心  孩子們  我們現在安全了
Don't worry, my boys. We're safe now.

146
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,624
快
Quickly!

147
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,005
西底家
Zedekiah!

148
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,089
來  過來
Come, come.

149
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,428
請... 不要傷害他們  求你了  求你了
Please, don't hurt them! Please! Please!

150
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,764
上帝啊
Dear God!

151
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,975
上帝啊  不
Dear God, no!

152
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,106
請放開他們  哦,上帝,不
Leave them, please! Oh, God, no!

153
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,439
西底家王
King Zedekiah!

154
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,944
噓  噓  噓  噓
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

155
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,618
噓  噓  噓
Shh, shh, shh.

156
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,492
不  求你了  不
No! Please! No.

157
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,448
父親
Father!

158
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,408
求你了 求你了  不要
Please! Please, don't!

159
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,792
求你了  不要  請放過他們
Please, don't! Spare them. Please!

160
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,864
遺憾啊
A pity.

161
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,661
這是你最後所見
The last thing you'll ever see.

162
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,007
帶著他
Bring him.

163
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,636
快走
Move!

164
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,468
讓那些掉隊的死在這
Leave those stragglers to die!

165
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,774
猶大人被迫離鄉背井
The Jewish people are forced into exile...

166
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,979
向東行走500英裡才能到達巴比倫
a 500-mile journey east to Babylon.

167
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,449
快走  快走
Move! Move!

168
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,874
西底家是最後的大衛王朝最後一任君王
Zedekiah is the last of King David's descendants to reign.

169
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,667
快走
Move it!

170
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,713
以色列人的王朝到此結束
The Israelite monarchy ends here.

171
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,715
耶利米是成功逃生的極少數之一
Jeremiah is one of the few to escape.

172
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,216
他準備前往埃及  從此不再回來
He heads to Egypt, never to return.

173
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,401
繼續前進
Keep moving.

174
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,814
往前走
Move along!

175
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,870
猶大人失去了他們的先知
The people have lost their prophet,

176
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,082
他們的城市和他們的王 快走！前進！
their city and their king. Move! Get along!

177
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,582
你  站起來
You there, on your feet!

178
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,792
亞撒利雅  舉起來
Azariah, lift.

179
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,802
加油
Come on!

180
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,797
加油  快
Come on! Quickly!

181
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,180
猶大民族需要一位不一樣的領袖
The Jewish nation needs a different kind of leader...

182
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,227
才能在巴比倫生存
to survive in Babylon.

183
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,432
一個像但以理這樣的人
A man like Daniel.

184
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,915
但以理擁有先知的能力
Daniel has visionary powers...

185
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,252
被迫在尼布甲尼撒的宮廷內工作
and is forced to work in Nebuchadnezzar's court.

186
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,431
沒有一個人
Has no one...

187
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,889
可以告訴我些什麼嗎
anything to tell me?

188
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,648
你們都描述不出我的夢嗎
Can you not even describe my dream?

189
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,652
我需要的不是沉默
Silence is no answer.

190
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,156
你們本應是"智慧人"
You're supposed to be wise men,

191
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,534
"巫術師"  "先見"
sorcerers, seers.

192
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,490
你們看到了什麼
So, what do you see?

193
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,547
陛下
Sire.

194
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,133
請原諒我
Forgive me.

195
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,927
這裡沒有人能讀懂你的心
No one here can read your mind.

196
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,854
那養你們有何用處
Then what use are any of you?

197
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,681
但上帝可以
But my God can.

198
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,110
他給我看了你的夢
He has shown me your dream.

199
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,358
那你就能告訴我
Then you will be able to tell it to me...

200
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,941
每一個細節
every detail.

201
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,994
你看到了一座巨人雕像
You saw a giant statue of a man,

202
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,328
雕像的頭由金制成
its head made of gold.

203
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,707
然後一塊巨石撞向雕像  將它砸得粉碎
Then a giant stone struck the statue, smashing it to pieces.

204
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,379
這就是我知道的！
I know that much!

205
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,754
這意味著什麼
What does it mean?

206
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,212
這座雕像代表著將臣服於巴比倫的國家
The statue represents the empires that will follow yours.

207
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,923
您的王國就是那黃金頭像
Yours is the greatest...

208
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,054
傲視群雄
the head of gold.

209
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,728
那破壞雕像的石塊呢
And the stone that destroys the statue?

210
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,931
那是上帝的天國
That is the kingdom of God.

211
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,485
將來上帝會君臨世界直到永久
In the future, God will reign over all the world forever.

212
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,484
被上帝毀滅
Destroyed by God.

213
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,407
是的  陛下
Yes, sire.

214
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,245
你叫什麼名字
What's your name?

215
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,493
但以理
Daniel.

216
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,088
你是名勇者  但以理
You're a brave man, Daniel.

217
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,589
我欣賞這一點
I value that.

218
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,933
你來為我效力
You will serve me.

219
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,608
就照他們說的做
Just do as they say.

220
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,525
我們還會回到耶路撒冷嗎
Will we ever return to Jerusalem?

221
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,908
耶利米保證過... 終有一天我們會的
Jeremiah promised that- that one day we would.

222
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,784
到那時  我們該怎麼做
And in the meantime, what do we do?

223
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,706
對這個暴君俯首稱臣嗎
Just bow our heads and serve this monster?

224
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,750
我受不了了
I can't do it anymore.

225
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,624
想想我們的子民  亞撒利雅
Think about our people, Azariah.

226
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,047
只要我們在宮廷內有了一席之地  我們就能幫助他們
As long as we're in the king's court, we can help them.

227
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,624
如果我們坐牢或者死了  就幫不了他們了
Imprisoned or dead, we can't.

228
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,757
尼布甲尼摧毀了上帝的聖殿  迫使我們流亡國外...
Nebuchadnezzar destroyed God's temple, forced us into exile.

229
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,634
我的名字是亞撒利雅
My name is Azariah.

230
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,590
意思是'受助於上帝的人'
「He who is helped by God.」

231
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,685
現在我要祈求上帝助我一臂之力
Well, I call upon God to help me now.

232
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,138
如果你不低頭，他會殺了你
He'll kill you if you won't bow.

233
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,319
我辦不到
I can not.

234
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,864
我不會敬拜他的
I will not worship that.

235
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,294
開始
NOW!

236
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,399
我們衷心追隨您...
With all our hearts, we follow you.

237
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,942
低頭
Bow your heads!

238
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,940
我們尋求您的存在
We seek your presence.

239
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,738
我全心全意追隨您
With all my heart, I follow you.

240
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,239
敬畏您  尋求您的存在
I fear you. I seek your presence.

241
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,738
抓住他們
Bring them!

242
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,915
我的朋友們  你們的信仰將會在此刻經受考驗
Oh, my friends, your faith will be tested now.

243
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,491
但以理
Daniel!

244
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,620
他們是怎麼回事
What's wrong with them?

245
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,674
為什麼你的朋友們不願叩拜於我
Why will your friends not bow to me?

246
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,502
陛下  我向您保證 他們會像我一樣忠誠地侍奉您
I assure you, sire, they will serve you faithfully all their lives,

247
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,258
但是...
as I will, but...

248
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,806
但是
But?

249
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,974
但是他們將只信仰上帝
But they will only worship God.

250
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,400
我會讓他們臣服的
I will make them bow.

251
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,073
我們追隨您  敬畏您
We follow you, we fear you,

252
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,651
我們用我們全部的心尋求你的存在
we seek your presence with all our heart.

253
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,362
我們追隨您  敬畏您  尋求您的存在
We follow you, we fear you, we seek your presence.

254
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,947
你們
You.

255
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:51,374
當我們想把堅硬穩固的東西弄彎時
When we wish to bend something that is hard and unyielding,

256
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,836
我們會怎麼做
what do we do with it?

257
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,592
我們將它扔入火海
We put it into the fire.

258
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,760
陛下
Majesty!

259
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,634
把他帶走  我們敬畏您
- Take him! - We fear you.

260
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,091
我們尋求您的存在  尊敬的陛下
- And we seek your presence! - Your Majesty!

261
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,800
燒死他們  陛下  不要
- Burn them! - Majesty, no!

262
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,012
燒死他們  拿木材來
Burn them! Wood!

263
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,188
給我拿木材來
Bring me wood.

264
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,147
把油拿來
Bring oil!

265
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,769
來吧！
Come!

266
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,646
來吧！求你救救我
Come! Please save me.

267
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,903
點火
Fire!

268
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,610
給我點火
Bring me fire!

269
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,367
耶和華阿  求你聽我的禱告  留心聽我的呼求
Hear my prayer, O Lord. Hear my cry.

270
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,369
死亡的繩索纏繞著我
The cords of death entangle me.

271
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,997
陰間的痛苦抓消耗著我
The anguish of the grave consumes me.

272
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,702
請別忽視我的眼淚
Do not ignore my tears.

273
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,208
我遭遇患難愁苦
I am overcome by sorrow.

274
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,173
我求告耶和華的名
I call upon the name of the Lord!

275
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,797
耶和華  求你救我的靈魂
Lord, save me!

276
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,096
上帝傾聽我的呼求
The Lord is my light.

277
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,848
上帝聽到我的禱告
The Lord receives my prayer.

278
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,855
敵人將被威懾
My enemies will be daunted.

279
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,403
他們都將恥辱而回
They will turn back in shame.

280
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,654
為什麼燒不死他們
Why do they not burn?

281
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,306
上帝
Lord.

282
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,563
這是奇跡
It's a miracle.

283
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,937
猶大子民都起來吧
People of Judah, rise.

284
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,615
上帝與我們同在  上帝與我們同在
God is with us. He's with us.

285
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,411
上帝與我們同在
God is with us.

286
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,719
大火中的奇跡將猶大人緊密團結起來
The miracle in the tire unites the Jewish people.

287
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,548
在流亡中  他們對上帝的信仰沒有被削弱
Far from allowing their faith to weaken in exile,

288
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,634
反而更加堅定
they reaffirm their trust in God.

289
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,726
摩西在西奈山得到的《十誡》
The laws and histories that Moses received on Mount Sinai...

290
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,481
與《約書亞記》
are preserved...

291
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:06,657
《撒母耳記》和《列王記》一同被編纂保存下來
and compiled with the books of Joshua, Samuel and Kings.

292
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:12,329
這幾部分構成了《希伯來聖經》的核心
Together, they form the heart of the Hebrew Bible.

293
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,542
雖然猶大人有自己的信仰
The Jewish people have their faith,

294
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,220
但他們仍是階下囚
but they're still prisoners.

295
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,717
唯一能釋放他們的人
And the only man who can set them free...

296
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,720
已經瘋了
has lost his mind.

297
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,158
看看你如今的樣子  尼布甲尼撒
So here you are, Nebuchadnezzar,

298
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,949
上帝領土上最偉大的王
the greatest king...

299
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,328
現在卻成了賤民
and lowliest man on God's earth.

300
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,873
看看你的驕傲給你帶來了怎樣的下場
See where your pride has brought you?

301
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,954
又給我們帶來了怎樣的不幸
And us.

302
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,710
你本可以還我們自由
You could have set us free.

303
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,468
而現在  我們和你一樣不得解脫
Now we are as trapped as you.

304
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,467
噓  噓
Shh. Shh.

305
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,761
噓
Shh.

306
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,974
喂
Here.

307
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,702
新王將立
A new king is coming.

308
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,081
祈求上帝讓他還我們自由
Please God let him deliver us.

309
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,987
尼布甲尼撒死後幾年
Within a few years of Nebuchadnezzar's death,

310
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,160
一支龐大的軍隊來到巴比倫
a massive army approaches Babylon...

311
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,739
該軍隊由波斯王古列領導
led by Cyrus, king of Persia.

312
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,255
讓他們知道我們來了
Let them know we've arrived.

313
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,484
巴比倫人知道自己沒有勝算
The Babylonians know they don't stand a chance.

314
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,826
他們不戰而降  將古列迎入城內
They let Cyrus in without a fight.

315
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,880
古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus!

316
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:12,256
古列  古列  古列  古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

317
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,928
古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus!

318
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,882
古列  古列  古列
Cyrus!  Cyrus! Cyrus!

319
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:22,971
古列  古列  古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

320
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:27,729
如果預言是正確的  那麼古列會釋放我們
Cyrus will set us free, if the prophecy's right.

321
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,357
古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus!

322
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,188
古列  古列  古列
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

323
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,661
為了保護他的猶大同胞
To protect his fellow Jews,

324
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
但以理一面與古列親近
Daniel befriends Cyrus...

325
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,126
一面繼續詮釋夢境
and continues to interpret dreams.

326
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,875
但以理  你的夢境意味著什麼
But what does your dream mean, Daniel?

327
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:58,931
那不是我的夢  陛下  巴比倫有一位先知名叫以賽亞
It's not my dream, sire. There's a prophet here in Babylon- Isaiah.

328
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:04,979
他說"有一位王  我攙扶他的右手 使列國降伏在他面前"
He says, 「Here is a king whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him.

329
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,023
"他叫古列"
He is Cyrus.」

330
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,018
他說的就是你  陛下
He names you, sire.

331
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,229
這意味著上帝與你同在
It means God is with you.

332
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,614
你的馬屁拍得很到位
I think you fatter me.

333
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,828
但是還沒有人會因奉承而喪命
But no one has ever died of fattery.

334
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,248
陛下立下眾多豐功偉業
Your Majesty has done many great things,

335
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,543
必將名垂青史
as the record will show.

336
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,877
理所應當
As it should.

337
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,274
我是古列  萬國之王
「I am Cyrus, king of the world.」

338
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,271
可他堅信但以理的每句話
Yet he hangs on Daniel's every word...

339
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,949
就像沒有獨立思考的能力一般
like he's lost the power to think for himself.

340
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,407
必須除掉但以理
Daniel must be removed.

341
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,124
一個月不准禱告
One month without prayer.

342
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,922
無疑只有叛徒才會反對
Surely only a traitor would object.

343
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,752
我不能言而無信  我已承諾人民信仰自由
I cannot go back on my word. I promised them freedom to worship.

344
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,213
這只是考驗他們的忠誠而已
It is merely a test of their loyalty.

345
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,389
他們已經歷過那麼多統治者
They have had so many rulers.

346
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,435
我們要確認他們將您視為最終的
We wanted to make sure they saw you as the final,

347
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,855
無與倫比的"萬國之王"
ultimate king of the world.

348
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,119
一個月不准禱告
One month without prayer.

349
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,243
也許古列覺得這麼做有意義  但他們知道我們不會照辦的
It probably sounds reasonable to Cyrus, but they know we can't comply.

350
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,623
他們壓根不是為了波斯王  不過是為了得到更大的權力罷了
They don't care about the king. They just want as much power over him as they can get.

351
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,625
所以要除掉你  免得你壞事
Which means they need you out of their way.

352
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,457
這是個圈套  他們想置我們於死地
It's a trap for all of us. They want us dead.

353
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,338
一整個月  你要怎麼做
A whole month. What will you do?

354
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,469
不知道
I don't know.

355
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,597
我只知道若不向上帝禱告  我自己也不能活
But I do know I can't live long without praying to God.

356
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,940
神阿  求你以你的名救我
Save me, O God, by your name.

357
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,776
請憐憫我
Have mercy on me...

358
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,697
以永恆的慈愛
according to your unfailing love.

359
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,874
神阿  求你為我造清潔的心
Create in me a pure heart, O God,

360
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,878
使我裡面重新有正直的靈
and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

361
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:11,642
不要丟棄我  使我離開你的面  不要從我收回你的聖靈
Do not cast me from your presence or take your holy spirit from me,

362
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,970
求你使我仍得救贖的喜悅
but restore to me the joy of your salvation...

363
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,515
賜我樂意的靈
and grant me a willing spirit...

364
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,692
扶持我
to sustain me.

365
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,741
但以理因為違抗古列之令
For disobeying Cyrus,

366
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,454
被捕並被判處死刑
Daniel is arrested and sentenced to death.

367
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:10,426
神阿  求你以你的名救我
Save me, O God, by your name.

368
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,930
請憐憫我
Have mercy on me...

369
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,133
以你永恆的慈愛...
according to your unfailing love.

370
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,196
第二天早上，古列意識到
The next morning, Cyrus realizes...

371
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,194
他犯了一個嚴重的錯誤
he's made a terrible mistake.

372
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:34,367
陛下  您身體不適嗎
Sire, are you unwell?

373
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,115
我一直睡不著
I haven't slept.

374
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,912
神啊  但願我沒來晚
Please god I'm not too late.

375
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,910
陛下  要我請醫師來嗎
Sire, shall I call the physician?

376
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,957
我錯待了我的朋友
I have wronged my friend!

377
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,171
開門
Open it.

378
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,157
但以理
Daniel.

379
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,894
神與你同在
God is with you.

380
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,058
你的神確實存在
Your God is real.

381
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,357
你的神救了你  是的
Your God has saved you. Yes.

382
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,489
吾古列  以萬國之王之名下旨
I am Cyrus, king of the world, and my judgment is this.

383
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,867
你的人民可以回到耶路撒冷
Your people shall return to Jerusalem.

384
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,323
他們的神會很高興
Their God will be pleased,

385
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,661
只可惜  他們沒有可以供奉他的聖殿
though, sadly, they no longer have a temple to worship him in.

386
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,549
把他扔進去喂獅子
Throw him in with the lions.

387
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,352
不
No!

388
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,725
不  不
No! No!

389
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,722
你知道這是什麼嗎
Do you know what this is?

390
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,178
哦
Oh.

391
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,189
是耶路撒冷聖殿裡的器物
It's from the temple in Jerusalem.

392
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,312
真美
It's beautiful.

393
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,393
我從沒見過有人用它
You know, I've never seen it used.

394
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,106
一直待在巴比倫  恐怕我也沒機會用了
And staying here in Babylon, I suppose now I never will.

395
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,691
但我們的子孫可以  等他們重返耶路撒冷
But our children will when they get to Jerusalem,

396
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,744
等到聖殿重建  家國復還之時
when the temple is rebuilt and our nation is restored.

397
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,781
我們的抗爭就勝利了
Our struggle is over.

398
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,494
我想給你看個東西  跟我來
There's something I need to show you. Come with me.

399
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,631
看啊
Look.

400
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,176
我們的人民要回家了
Our people are heading home.

401
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,351
背井離鄉數十載
After decades in exile,

402
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,899
他們依然團結一致  充滿希望和信念
moving as one,

403
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,523
充滿希望和信念
with hope and purpose.

404
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,107
他們已經等得太久了
They've waited so long for this.

405
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,654
但我擔心他們的未來  我們上路了！我們要回家！
But I fear for their future. We're on our way! We're going home!

406
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,032
我做了一個夢
I had a dream.

407
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,873
夢裡我看到一只巨大的野獸
I saw a great beast...

408
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,341
面目猙獰  力大無窮
dreadful and terrible and unimaginably strong.

409
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,551
它有巨大的鐵獠牙
It had great iron teeth.

410
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,930
吞噬了整個世界
And it devoured the whole world.

411
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,515
但神不會棄我們而去
But God will not abandon us.

412
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,772
我在夢中還看見了一個偉大的新領袖
I saw a great new leader.

413
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,072
我看見有一位像人子的
In my dream, there before me was one, like a son of man,

414
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,946
駕著天雲而來
coming with the clouds of heaven.

415
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:49,031
得了權柄  榮耀  國度
He was given authority, glory and sovereign power.

416
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,876
各國  各族的人都事奉他
Nations and men of every language worshipped him.

417
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,043
這不是結局  亞撒利雅
This isn't the end, Azariah.

418
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,542
而是開始
It's the beginning.

419
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,424
猶大人需要幫助
The Jewish people will need help...

420
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,387
才能幸免於即將來臨的災難
to survive what is coming.

421
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,891
之後的500年裡
Over the next 500 years,

422
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,773
他們弱小的國家屢遭侵犯
their tiny nation is attacked again and again.

423
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:24,441
接著他們臣服於羅馬帝國的統治
Then they succumb to the might of Rome.

424
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,697
去排隊  你不能做這個
- Get in line! - You can't do this.

425
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,699
把它放在這裡  羅馬的貪婪
- Put it here- all of it! - Roman greed.

426
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,874
羅馬的法制
Roman law.

427
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,956
羅馬式懲罰
Roman punishment.

428
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,590
以色列遭受了前所未有的痛苦
Israel suffers like never before.

429
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:48,257
他們每天都在祈禱一位新大衛王的降臨
Every day, the people pray for a new King David...

430
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,219
來拯救他們
to lead them to salvation.

431
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,976
下集《聖經》預告
Next time on The Bible.

432
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,854
馬利亞  我的未婚妻
Mary, my betrothed.

433
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:02,028
你有著我所見過最迷人的雙眼
You have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen...

434
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,822
和最甜美的笑容
and the sweetest smile.

435
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,901
我很好奇  您知道將來的新王些什麼
I wonder, what can you tell me of the new king?

436
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,529
你現在看到的希律王
Are you not looking at Herod,

437
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,412
難道不是猶太人的王嗎
king of the Jews?

438
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,254
當然是  那還有誰自稱為王
Of course. Then who is claiming to be king?

439
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,298
現在還沒有  他尚未出世
No one. He's not born yet.

440
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,297
這是一個預言  星宿昭示了他的降臨
It' is a prophecy heralded by the star.

441
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,756
殺了他們！把他們全殺了！
Kill them! Kill them all!

442
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,100
我得到了你！快點！他來了！約瑟，他來了！
I've got you! Hurry! He's coming now! Joseph, he's coming!

443
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,433
我為你們施洗禮  準備迎接新的國度吧
I baptise you, ready for the new kingdom.

444
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,310
你已潔凈
As you are cleansed,

445
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,654
所有以色列人也將和你一樣潔凈
so all Israel shall be cleansed.

446
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,198
人們都成群結隊去找那個野人似的約翰
The people are flocking to this wild man, John.

447
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:48,866
甚至有人認為他就是彌賽亞
Some even call him the messiah.

448
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,662
那你可得好好留心這位彌賽亞了
Then you need to keep an eye on your messiah.

449
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,460
即將到來的那一位  大過我
There is one to come, greater than me,

450
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,708
他將用火來施洗
who will baptise with fire.

451
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,506
我不過是曠野中的吶喊
I'm just a voice in the wilderness,

452
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,801
做好準備迎接...
preparing the way for the...

453
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,801
上帝
Lord.

454
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,979
就在這裡  在外面
He's here. Out there.

455
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,986
開啟人的心智
Opening the hearts of all men.

456
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,990
凱撒的命令  異教活動必須停止
Orders from Caesar. This dissent' must' stop.

457
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,712
我們要做什麼
What are we going to do?

458
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,718
改變世界
Change the world.

459
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:02,315
他將帶來正義與公平的新時代
He will bring a new age of righteousness and justice!

460
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,860
他的力量將帶領人類邁向新世界
His power will draw all men to a new world!

461
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,528
全人類
All People!
