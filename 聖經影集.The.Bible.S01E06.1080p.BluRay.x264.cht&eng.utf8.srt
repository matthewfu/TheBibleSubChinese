堅持住  我去找個庇護所
Hold on! I'm gonna find somewhere.

145
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,741
有人嗎
Hello?

146
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,374
-回來  他要降生了  -能幫幫我們嗎
- He's coming! - Can anybody help us?

147
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,172
他要降生了  約瑟  現在
He's coming, Joseph, now!

148
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,220
我來了  好吧  來吧
I'm coming! All right. Come on.

149
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,796
堅持住
Hold on!

150
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,893
跟緊我
Stay with me.

151
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,610
陛下  占星師巴爾薩扎覲見
Sire. The astrologer Balthazar.

152
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,609
巴爾薩扎
Balthazar.

153
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,365
過來
Come.

154
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,704
喝點酒嗎
Wine?

155
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,497
謝謝您的款待  陛下
You're very gracious, Your Majesty.

156
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,452
我就不用了
I'd rather not.

157
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,413
我很好奇  對那將來的新王您知道些什麼
I wonder, what can you tell me of the new king?

158
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,632
-王  -猶太人的王
King? Of the Jews.

159
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,131
有他的消息嗎
Yes. What news of him?

160
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,923
猶太人的王
King of the Jews?

161
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,179
我是不是聽錯了
Am I missing something?

162
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,606
你來這兒不就是
Did you not come here...

163
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,732
覲見猶太人的王嗎
to see the king of the Jews?

164
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,156
你現在看到的希律王  
Are you not looking at Herod,

165
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,405
難道不是猶太人的王嗎
king of the Jews?

166
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,995
當然是
Of course.

167
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,573
那還有誰自稱為王
Then who is claiming to be king?

168
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,705
現在還沒有  他尚未出世
No one. He's not born yet.

169
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,505
這是一個預言  星宿昭示了他的降臨
It is a prophecy heralded by the star.

170
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,083
您的文士肯定也收到了啟示
Surely your scribes have received the revelation.

171
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,840
星宿  預言
Stars! Prophecies!

172
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,014
你打斷我進餐就為了這個
You interrupt my meal for this?

173
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,596
如果你不介意的話  回去吧
Please, if you don't mind.

174
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,323
希律王什麼也不知道
Herod knows nothing.

175
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,408
跟著星星走
We follow the star.

176
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,338
那個大逆不道的預言會在哪裡應驗
Where is this treacherous prophecy?

177
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,340
找到了嗎
Have you found it?

178
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,763
-在這兒
Ah, here.

179
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,678
讀給我聽  "以賽亞...
Read it! 「Isaiah.

180
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,021
因此主自己要給你們一個兆頭"
Therefore, the Lord himself will give a sign.」

181
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,442
看  看那兒
Look. Look. There.

182
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,199
"必有童女懷孕生子"
「A young woman will conceive and give birth to a son.」

183
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,085
請幫幫我們
Help us! Please!

184
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,301
"他名稱為奇妙..."
「He will be called Wonderful.」

185
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,346
馬利亞  我扶著你
Mary! I've got you.

186
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,094
"策士..."
「Counsellor.」

187
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,890
請幫幫我們
Help us, please!

188
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,931
跟我來  "全能的神..."
Follow me. "Mighty God."

189
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,432
Sir, we need help!

190
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,056
"永在的父..."  快
"Everlasting Father." Quickly!

191
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,526
"和平的君"  這裡會是乾的
- Prince of Peace. - It'll be dry in here.

192
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,118
加油  加油
Come on. Come on.

193
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,294
但我才是帶來和平的人
But I am the one who brings peace!

194
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,722
你覺得一個孩子能做到嗎
Do you think some child could do that?

195
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,432
預言裡說沒說這個"和平的君"將在哪裡降生
Is it written where this mighty prince will be born?

196
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,978
米迦說他將出生在伯利恆
Micah says it will be Bethlehem.

197
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,856
伯利恆...
Bethlehem.

198
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,658
在伯利恆
Bethlehem!

199
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,906
集合部隊
Gather the troops!

200
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,671
我們的兒子..
Our son.

201
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,592
感謝上帝
Thanks be to God.

202
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,712
夫人  我相信您的兒子
Lady, I believe your son...

203
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,173
必是其子民未來的王
is the promised king of his people.

204
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,885
他叫什麼名字
What is his name?

205
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,722
耶穌
Jesus.

206
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,065
他的名字是耶穌
His name is Jesus.

207
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,468
馬利亞
Mary!

208
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,045
馬利亞
Mary!

209
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,698
馬利亞
Mary!

210
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:59,903
馬利亞
Mary!

211
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,536
我們得走了  馬上出發
We have to leave. Now.

212
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,872
我也沒法解釋  相信我就好
I can't explain. Just trust me.

213
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,677
當希律王聽說有一位新的王在伯利恆誕生
When Herod hears a new king is being born in Bethlehem,

214
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,806
他便下令殺死所有嬰兒
he orders the murder of e very infant boy.

215
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,263
把你們找到的嬰兒都殺死
Kill any you find!

216
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,979
這邊
This way.

217
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,526
不
No.

218
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,274
快  都抓起來
Quickly! Get 'em all!

219
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,029
我的兒子
My son!

220
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,366
搶下那個男孩
Take the boy.

221
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,493
不
No!

222
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,960
這是對無辜平民的屠殺
The massacre of the innocents.

223
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,934
只有一個孩子免於此難
One child escapes.

224
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,640
希律王永遠不會知道  
Herod will never know...

225
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,523
在伯利恆的屠殺   其實是徒勞無功
that the slaughter in Bethlehem was for nothing.

226
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,530
他也行將就木
He's dying...

227
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,573
他的最後一個偏執舉動
His last paranoid act...

228
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,199
就是以謀反的罪名處死了自己的長子
the execution of his eldest son for plotting against him.

229
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,040
父親  求你了
Father, please.

230
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,618
希律王死後
When Herod dies,

231
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,123
人民看到了重獲自由的希望
the people sense an opportunity to win their freedom.

232
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,169
以色列人爆發了
Israel explodes.

233
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,217
但羅馬人也沒有手軟
But the Roman response is brutal.

234
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,638
團結在一起
Keep together!

235
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,297
叛亂被殘酷地鎮壓了
The uprising is crushed.

236
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,678
僅加利利地區
In Galilee alone,

237
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,477
就有兩千人被釘十字架
2,000 are crucified.

238
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,621
耶穌和他的家人從埃及返回
Jesus and his family return from Egypt.

239
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,581
我們就快到了  耶穌
We're nearly there, Jesus.

240
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,293
馬上就到家了
We're almost home.

241
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,051
一個十年的黑暗已經籠罩著以色列
A decade of darkness has fallen over Israel.

242
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,277
約瑟
Joseph!

243
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,169
他們有何過錯
What have they done?

244
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,300
我們要相信上帝自有安排
We must trust in God's plan...

245
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,090
一如他信任我們
as he trusts in us.

246
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,762
羅馬帝國直接控制了將耶路撒冷和猶太地區
Rome has taken direct control of Jerusalem and Judaea.

247
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,260
希律的兒子安提帕正在等待著
Herod's son Antipas...

248
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,390
二十年來羅馬的第四任巡撫來臨
awaits the arrival of the fourth Roman governor in 20 years...

249
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,812
傲慢殘忍的本丟．彼拉多巡撫
the arrogant and ruthless Pontius Pilate.

250
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,071
歡迎  巡撫
Greetings, prefect.

251
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,153
歡迎來到猶太
Welcome to Judaea.

252
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,331
希望您能在這裡擁有一份充實
I hope your time here will be prosperous...

253
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,906
平和的生活
and peaceful.

254
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,368
我也正打算如此
I intend to make sure it is.

255
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,829
凱撒的命令
Orders from Caesar.

256
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,505
異教活動必須停止
This dissent must stop.

257
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,091
對於彼拉多和安提帕來說
For Pilate and Antipas,

258
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,216
任何群眾集會都具有威脅性
any gathering of people is a threat.

259
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,890
悔改吧  如此才能得到救贖
Repent! And your sins shall be forgiven.

260
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,052
在約旦河岸
At the River Jordan,

261
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,763
人們絡繹不絕地來找施洗約翰
crowds flocking to John the Baptist.

262
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,566
我為你們施洗  準備迎接新的國度吧
I baptise you, ready for the new kingdom.

263
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,022
你已潔凈
As you are cleansed,

264
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,027
所有以色列人也將和你一樣潔凈
so all Israel shall be cleansed!

265
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,078
你就是彌賽亞嗎
(指受膏者  即預言中的耶穌猶太人所期待的救世主)
Are you the messiah?

266
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,373
在這裡  我在等  在那等  
- Here. I'm waiting. - Keep back here.

267
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,315
-你說有麻煩
You said there was trouble.

268
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,615
-在沙漠地帶   人們都成群結隊去找那個野人似的約翰
In the desert, the people are flocking to this wild man- John.

269
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,113
他們認為他是先知
They think he's a prophet.

270
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,570
甚至有人認為他就是彌賽亞
Some even call him the messiah.

271
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,247
你當真悔改了嗎
Do you truly repent?

272
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,459
上帝的斧頭已備好
God's axe is ready.

273
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,794
每個不結好果子的樹
Every tree that does not produce good fruit...

274
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:40,131
都將被砍下來  丟進火裡
will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

275
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,851
所有人都將見證神的救贖
All flesh shall see the salvation of God!

276
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,023
彌賽亞又是什麼
And what is a messiah?

277
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,066
是猶太人的救世主
The redeemer of the Jews.

278
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,113
受膏於上帝  來解放他們
Anointed by God to set them free.

279
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:07,242
那你可得好好留心這位彌賽亞了
Then you need to keep an eye on your messiah.

280
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,642
即將到來的那一位  大過我
There is one to come, greater than me,

281
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,944
他將用火來施洗
who will baptise with fire.

282
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,442
我不過是曠野中的吶喊
I am just a voice in the wilderness,

283
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,524
做好準備  迎接...
preparing the way for the...

284
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,827
主
Lord.

285
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,544
別停
Don't stop.

286
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,173
我理該當受你的洗啊
Surely I need you to baptise me.

287
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,333
約翰  你所行的是正道
John, what you are doing is right.

288
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,289
為我施洗吧
Baptise me.

289
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,252
受洗後  耶穌被聖靈帶進入曠野
After his baptism, Jesus enters the wilderness.

290
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,881
在曠野中的四十天  他的靈魂飽受考驗
For 40 days, his spirit is tested,

291
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,466
為他之後將要面臨的挑戰做準備
preparing him for the challenges to come.

292
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,668
撒但
Satan.

293
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,478
你若是  神的兒子
If you are the Son of God,

294
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,444
可以吩咐這石頭變成食物
command that this stone becomes bread.

295
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,585
但人活著
Man...

296
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,413
不是單靠食物
shall not live by bread alone,

297
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,548
乃是靠神口裡所出的一切話
but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.

298
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,352
如果上帝愛你
If God loves you,

299
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,100
可以從這裡跳下去
throw yourself down.

300
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,934
因為他的使者會用手托著你
His angels will lift you up in their hands.

301
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,855
你怎敢試探神
How dare you put God to the test!

302
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,864
你若在我面前下拜
If you will bow down and worship me,

303
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,745
我就把全世界都給你
I will give you the whole world.

304
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,591
釘死他
Crucify him!

305
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,947
撒但  走開
Get away from me, Satan.

306
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:50,293
我拜主我的神  我的上帝
I worship the Lord my God...

307
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:55,968
單要事奉他
and serve him only.

308
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,697
耶穌抵擋住了撒但的誘惑
Jesus resists Satan's temptations...

309
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,823
並準備開始完成他的使命
and prepares to begin his mission.

310
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,040
但施洗的約翰無法與他同行
But it will be without John the Baptist.

311
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,164
他已經被安提帕逮捕了
He has been arrested by Antipas.

312
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,212
快點  你這賤民
Come on, scum!

313
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,711
進去
Get in. In!

314
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:35,551
耶穌回到了他的家鄉加利利

315
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:39,001
遠離耶路撒冷政權

316
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,801
啟程前往內海海岸

317
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,181
他的使命始於這裡

318
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,253
需要幫忙嗎
Do you need help?

319
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,960
我不是在尋求幫助
I'm not looking for any help.

320
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,719
更何況  也沒什麼可幫的
And besides, there's nothing to help with.

321
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,066
你在幹什麼
Hey. What are you doing?

322
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,197
你不能就這麼爬上我的船
You can't just climb into my boat!

323
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,655
沒錯  你說得對  助我一臂之力吧
Yeah, you're right. Give me a helping hand.

324
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,435
你這是幹什麼呢
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,978
我們要去捕魚
We're going fishing.

326
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,022
大白天的  沒有魚可捕
There are no fish out there this time of day.

327
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,600
其實  什麼時候都捕不到魚
In fact, there are no fish out here any time of day.

328
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,185
彼得
Peter.

329
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,781
給我一小時
Just give me an hour,

330
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,154
我將給你一個全新的生活
and I will give you a whole new life.

331
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,736
誰說我想要什麼新生活了
Who says I want one?

332
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,829
都跟你說了
I tell you.

333
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,211
現在沒有魚可捕
There's no fish out there.

334
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,686
我該怎麼處置你呢
What am I going to do with you?

335
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,778
你  還有你那張危險的嘴
You and your dangerous mouth.

336
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,192
靜靜聆聽
Listen.

337
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,571
聽一個煽動暴亂的傻瓜嗎
To a seditious fool?

338
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,527
算了吧
I don't think so.

339
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:29,738
聽上帝的旨意
To God's message.

340
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,907
'天國近了'
The kingdom of heaven is near.

341
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:37,416
這麼說  你承認自己是彌賽亞了
So you do claim to be the messiah?

342
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,798
不
No.

343
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,251
但你認為他要來了
But you think he's coming.

344
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,713
不
No.

345
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,097
他已經來了
He's already here.

346
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,106
就在這裡
He's here.

347
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,524
在外面
Out there.

348
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,904
傳播神的真理
Speaking God's truth,

349
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:13,498
開啟人的心智
opening the hearts of all men.

350
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,853
這是怎麼回事
How did this happen?

351
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,028
你做了什麼
What did you do?

352
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,611
我在給你改變人生的機會
I'm giving you the chance to change your life.

353
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,293
彼得  來跟從我
Peter, come with me.

354
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,422
別再捕魚了  我要叫你
Give up catching fish, and I will make you...

355
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,251
得人如得魚一樣
a fisher of men.

356
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,383
我們要做什麼
What are we going to do?

357
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,805
改變世界
Change the world.

358
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,406
他將帶來正義與公平的新時代
He will bring a new age of righteousness and justice!

359
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,864
他的力量將帶領人類邁向新世界
His power will draw all men to a new world.

360
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,745
全人類
All People!

361
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,074
下集《聖經》預告
Next time on The Bible.

362
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,621
馬利亞  他回來了
Mary, he's here!

363
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,788
-誰  -耶穌  他終於回來了
Who? Jesus! He's back!

364
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,420
我聽說了一個年輕先知
I've had reports of a young prophet,

365
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,293
拿撒勒人耶穌
a Jesus of Nazareth.

366
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,374
他在加利利有一大批追隨者
He has a big following in Galilee.

367
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,132
傳聞說他會來耶路撒冷
It's rumoured he'll come to Jerusalem.

368
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,213
他能創造奇跡
He works miracles.

369
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,594
大家都這麼說
They all do.

370
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,891
虛心的人有福了  因為天國是他們的
Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

371
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,770
溫柔的人有福了  因為他們必承受地土
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

372
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:30,937
你說什麼  你說你就是被上帝選中派來人間的彌賽亞嗎
What are you saying?  that you are the messiah,the chosen one sent by God?

373
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,237
不可能
No!

374
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,031
預言開始應驗了
It has begun.

375
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,787
有五千人前往見他
5,000 came to see him.

376
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,081
五千人
5,000.

377
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,750
有人說那個耶穌把一個死人救活了
They say this Jesus has raised a man from the dead.

378
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,420
凡活著信我的人必永遠不死
Whoever believes in me shall never die.

379
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:52,342
你會為此付出代價   正如你的朋友施洗約翰一樣
You will pay the price for this, like your friend John the Baptist!

380
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,264
過些日子我們就去耶路撒冷
Soon we go to Jerusalem.

381
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,965
那太危險了！
It's too dangerous.

382
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:03,895
耶穌從加利利來耶路撒冷過逾越節
The messiah from Galilee in Jerusalem at Passover. How timely.

383
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,894
如果他與萬千擁護者相伴而來
What if he comes with thousands of supporters?

384
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,816
隨著慶祝節日的人們相繼到來
The city will already be breaking at the seams...

385
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,564
這城將會人滿為患
with those arriving for the festival.

386
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,862
猶太人的王
King of the Jews!

387
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,689
你可以如軍隊般帶領我們
You can lead us like an army.

388
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,072
我們有能力擊敗羅馬人  不  不應該通過這種方式
- We're strong enough to beat the Romans! - No, this is not the way.

389
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,824
羅馬渣滓  羅馬強盜
Roman scum! Roman thieves!

390
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,908
要他們好看   羅馬強盜
Let us show them! Roman thieves!

391
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,119
彌賽亞  彌賽亞
Messiah! Messiah!

392
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,952
他們希望你做他們的王
They want you to be their king.

393
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:38,804
我們必須阻止這個神棍  這個騙子
We must not allow this miracle man, this fraud,

394
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,973
來破壞逾越節
to disrupt Passover.

395
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,018
倘若你們渴望看見公義
If you hunger for righteousness,

396
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:48,143
你們將透過我看見
you will be filled... through me.

397
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,441
這事彼拉多知道嗎
Does Pilate know?

398
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,691
嗯
Hmm.
