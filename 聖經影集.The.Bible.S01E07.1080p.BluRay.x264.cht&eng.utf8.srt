1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,870
本劇改編自聖經  它們曾改變世界，直到如今
本劇將始終保持《聖經》真諦

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,700
《聖經》前情提要
Previously on The Bible...

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,760
猶太王國是由偉大的英雄們一手建立
Great heroes have forged the Jewish nation in faith.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,380
諾亞拯救地上的生物免遭洪水
Noah saved life on earth from the flood.

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,550
上帝警告我  要我造一艘船
God warned me. He told me to build a boat.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,450
亞伯拉罕成為萬國之父
Abraham became the father of God's nation.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,010
亞伯拉罕
Abraham!

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,760
摩西解放子民  帶他們擺脫埃及人的奴役
Moses freed the people from Egyptian slavery.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,340
主啊
Lord!

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,180
跟我走
Follow me!

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,940
然後  他頒布了上帝的法典
Then, he delivered God's laws.

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,080
我們有可以助我們奪下應許之地的新法典了
We have new laws preparing us for the Promised Land.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
偉大的大衛王團結以色列人
The great King David united the Israelites...

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,660
以色列
Israel!

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,350
攻下了耶路撒冷
and won the city of Jerusalem.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,210
但因被超級大國圍困
But surrounded by superpowers,

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,790
以色列一直為自身的存亡不斷抗爭
Israel's survival was a constant struggle.

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,350
然後羅馬帝國攻占了應許之地
Then Rome conquered the Promised Land.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,620
人們渴望大衛王再世  出現新的救世主
People long for a new King David, a savior.

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,100
有人認為那人便是施洗約翰
Some believed it was John the Baptist.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,580
你已潔凈  所有以色列人也將和你一樣
As you are cleansed, so all Israel shall be cleansed.

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,140
人們都成群結隊去找那個野人似的約翰
People are flocking to this wild man, John.

23
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,390
他們認為他是先知
They think he's a prophet.

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,120
我只是荒野裡的聲音
I am just a voice in the wilderness,

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,930
等待著主的
preparing the way for the...

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,810
到來
...Lord.

27
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,350
為我施洗吧
Baptize me!

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,070
他將帶來正義與公平的新時代
He will bring a new age of righteousness and justice.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
他的力量將帶領人類邁向新世界
His power will draw all men to a new world.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,070
全人類
All people!

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,660
耶穌開始招聚門徒
Jesus has started to gather disciples

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,530
他們放棄一切跟從他
who give up everthing to follow him.

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,100
來跟從我  彼得
Come with me, Peter.

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,780
別再捕魚了  我要叫你得人如得魚一樣
Give up catching fish and I will make you a fisher of men.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,870
如今他們與懼怕所有異教的
Now they are on a collision cause

36
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,980
當局站在了對立的兩面
with the temple of authorities who fear any Dissent.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,860
我聽說了一個年輕先知  叫拿撒勒人耶穌
I've had a report of a young prophet, Jesus of Nazareth.

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,200
而羅馬人  絕不會容忍此事
And Romans, who won't tolerate.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,180
是時候讓你們明白  主人為你們做了什麼
It's time you understood what your masters do for you.

40
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,920
-我們要做什麼  -改變世界
- What are we going to do? - Change the world.

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,680
聖經

42
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,410
加利利

43
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,520
在加利利這個窮鄉僻壤的地方  巨變要來了
In the poor backwater of Galilee, revolution is coming.

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,870
世世代代的以色列人都受
For generations, the people of Israel have been guided

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,460
猶太教守護者法利賽人的指引
by the Pharisees, guardians of the Jewish faith.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,990
你們必須堅定不移地遵守
You should untiringly keep the commandments

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,590
主你的神的誡命和律例
of the Lord your God and his statutes...

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,010
法利賽人相信民族的福祉
The Pharisees believe the well-being of the nation

49
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,780
在於嚴格遵守上帝給摩西的法典
depends on strictly observing the laws God gave to Moses.

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,620
他們深受人們愛戴
They are loved and admired by the people.

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,740
你們必須做正確的事  以及
You should do what is right and what is good

52
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,620
主眼裡正確的事
in sight of the Lord.

53
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,630
你看見他了嗎  就在那裡
Have you seen him? Over there!

54
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,090
但耶穌提供了一種新的方式
But Jesus offers a new way...

55
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,740
所以主吩咐我們要遵守所有律法
So the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes...

56
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,880
是耶穌
It's Jesus!

57
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,520
這邊  約翰  一直往前走不要停
This way, John. Keep everyone moving.

64
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,520
神的國  我們可用什麼比較呢
How shall we picture the kingdom of God?

65
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,800
它好像一粒芥菜種
It is like a mustard seed...

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,290
有人拿去種在田裡
...which a man took and sowed in his field,

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,910
比地上的百種都小
the smallest seed in the world.

68
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,050
但種上以後
Yet when planted...

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,360
就長起來
...it grows up...

70
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,410
卻比各樣的菜都大
...and becomes the biggest of all plants.

71
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,720
怎麼了
What's going on?

72
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,870
變成了樹  飛鳥也來它的枝上
It becomes a tree where birds can come...

73
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,540
他癱了
He's paralyzed.

74
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,970
...並在此築巢
... and make their nests.

75
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,260
你的罪赦了  孩子
Your sins are forgiven, my son.

76
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,420
你們聽到了嗎
Did you hear that?

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,540
他赦了他的罪
He has forgiven his sins.

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
不是只有神才能赦罪嗎
I thought only God could do that?

79
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,690
這不是僭妄嗎
Isn't that blasphemy?

80
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,260
他懂得的  這就是僭妄
He knows. It is blasphemy.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,180
你是這意思嗎  我的朋友
Is that your wish, my friend?

82
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,720
回答我啊
Well, answer me.

83
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,950
告訴我  
Tell me which is easier...

84
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,480
或說  他的罪赦了  
...to say his sins are forgiven,

85
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,980
或說  
or say...

86
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,380
你起來行走  那一樣容易呢
Get up and walk?

87
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,680
等等
Wait...

88
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,690
人子是有赦罪的權柄的
The Son of Man has authority to forgive sin.

89
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,640
朋友們
Friends!

90
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,940
什麼事
What is this about?

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,540
連摩西都不會覺得自己能夠赦他人的罪
Not even Moses himself would've thought he could forgive sin.

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,500
你聽到夫子是怎麼說了
You heard what our teacher said.

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,010
他到底憑什麼權柄可以這麼做
On what authority does he think he can do this?

94
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,530
就憑他自己的權柄
On his authority.

95
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,810
這是僭妄
That is blasphemy.

96
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,770
只有神才可以赦罪
Only God can forgive sin.

97
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,330
而你的朋友
And your friend

98
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,860
如此扯謊  可能會用石頭打死的
could be stoned for a false claim like this.

99
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,100
這不過才開始罷了
This is just the beginning.

100
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,220
我們走
Let's go.

101
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,410
隨著門徒的增多
With a growing number of disciples,

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,680
耶穌從這個城走到那個城
Jesus moves from town to town,

103
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,570
講述著神之國  並不斷創造神跡
teaching about god's kingdom and working miracles.

104
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,660
不潔  污穢  他長了麻風
Unclean, unclean. He's a Leper!

105
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,640
都避開他
Get away from him!

106
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,100
求你了  求你了
Please, please...

107
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,850
別碰他
Don't touch him!

108
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,840
我潔凈了  我潔凈了  我潔凈了
I'm clean, I'm clean. I'm clean!

109
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,320
對有些人來說  耶穌是救世主
Jesus is a savior to some...

110
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,480
看他都做了什麼
Look what he's done!

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,860
但對羅馬  他卻是個潛在威脅
...but a potential threat to Rome.

112
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,130
新任羅馬總督本丟．彼拉多
The new Roman governor is Pontius Pilate,

113
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,590
過去是軍人  如今成了一位殘酷的政客
an ex-soldier turned ruthless politician.

114
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,840
停  怎麼了
Halt! What's going on?

115
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,170
你們擋著路了  總督要過去
You're in the way! The Governor needs to pass.

116
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,590
彼拉多可不會等
Pilate won't wait!

117
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,480
還要等很久嗎
Will it be much longer?

118
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,420
很快就好  親愛的
Very soon, my love.

119
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,710
-長官  -這次因何停下
- Prefect... - What's the delay this time?

120
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,900
道中有輛破車  長官
It's a broken cart, sir.

121
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,360
那你們還等什麼  給我處理掉
What are you waiting for? Get it off the road!

122
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,240
搬開  搬開
Let's get it moved! Move it!

123
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,280
彼拉多統治下的猶太人瀕臨爆發
Rebellion simmers amongst Pilate's Jewish subjects,

124
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,980
但他不允許任何破壞羅馬統治
but he allows nothing to disrupt Roman rule...

125
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,450
和羅馬稅收的舉動
...or Roman taxes.

126
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,140
所有稅款必須繳清
All taxes must be paid in full!

127
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,210
我們同為猶太人  他們怎能如此
We're all Jews. How can they live with themselves?

128
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,870
自己人卻為羅馬人賣命  真讓人厭惡
Our own people working for Rome? These people makes me sick.

129
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,210
同流合污之徒  我們走吧
Collaborators. Let's move on.

130
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,320
都是些蠹蟲
They're stinking vermin.

131
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,150
你應該離他們遠一點
You should keep your distance from them.

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
兩個人
Two men...

133
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,180
去聖殿中禱告
... went to the temple to pray.

134
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,150
一個是偽善的法利賽人
One a Pharisee...

135
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,840
而另一個
... and the other one

136
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,520
是個稅吏
a tax collector.

137
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,570
法利賽人禱告說  神啊
The Pharisee prayed: God...

138
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,300
我感謝你  我不像別人
I thank you that I'm not like other men,

139
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,280
偷盜  奸淫
thieves, adulterers...

140
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,980
也不像這個稅吏
... or this tax collector.

141
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,310
但那稅吏
But the tax collector

142
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,420
連舉目望天也不敢
didn't even look up to heaven.

143
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,280
他說
He said,

144
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,790
神啊
God...

145
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,890
開恩可憐我
have mercy on me,

146
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,220
這個罪人
I'm a sinner.

147
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,840
神祝福了那個稅吏
God blessed the tax collector...

148
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,530
而不是法利賽人
not the Pharisee.

149
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,140
凡自高的  必降為卑
Anyone who praises himself will be humbled,

150
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,650
自卑的  必升為高
and anyone who humbles himself will be praised.

151
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,250
馬太  過來
Matthew...come.

152
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,400
看  現在他甚至叫罪人都跟著他
See, now he even calls the sinners to follow him!

153
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,110
讓人不禁好奇  其他跟他的人
One has to wonder of the sins committed

154
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,110
到底都是怎樣的人
by his other followers.

155
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,190
稅吏！
Tax collectors!

156
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,140
他們心中都沒有一絲善意
There's not a thread of good in any of them.

157
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,150
多馬  耶穌不是為好人而來
Thomas, Jesus has not come for the good,

158
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,860
而是為罪人而來
but for the sinners.

159
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,540
他給人們第二次機會
He gives people a second chance.

160
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,560
我們也應該這樣
We should too.

161
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
虛心的人有福了
Blessed are the poor,

162
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
《聖經原文》

163
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,560
因為天國是他們的
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

164
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,830
溫柔的人有福了
Blessed are the meek,

165
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,670
因為他們必承受地土
for they shall inherit the earth.

166
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,350
清心的人有福了
Blessed are the pure in heart,

167
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,610
因為他們必得見神
for they shall see God.

168
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,230
向他禱告  他必垂聽
Pray to him and he will listen.

169
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,140
我們應如何禱告
And how should we pray?

170
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,840
像這樣
Like this.

171
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,160
我們在天上的父
Our Father who is in heaven,

172
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,080
願人都尊你的名為聖
hallowed be your name.

173
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,490
願你的國降臨
Your kingdom come,

174
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,220
願你的旨意
your will be done,

175
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,120
行在地上  如同行在天上
on earth as it is in heaven.

176
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,970
我們日用的飲食  今日賜給我們
Give us this day our daily bread.

177
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,350
免我們的過犯
And forgive us our trespasses,

178
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,010
如同我們免了人的過犯
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

179
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,400
用石頭打死她  她是個妓女
Stone her! She's a whore!

180
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,740
大家都知道經上是怎麼說的
You know what it says in the Scriptures.

181
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,370
-這裡  -母親
- Here! - Mother!

182
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,400
救我  
Please!

183
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,340
-淫婦  -躲開點
- Adulteress! -Go away.

184
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,840
律法命令我們
The law commands us

185
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,000
用石頭砸死這個女人
to stone such a woman.

186
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,200
你怎麼看
What do you say?

187
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,030
這是個陷阱
It's a trap.

188
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,490
我會把我的石頭
I'll give my stone

189
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,030
給第一個敢對我說
to the first man who tells me

190
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,810
自己從未犯過罪的人
that he has never sinned.

191
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,170
謝謝你  謝謝你
Thank you, thank you.

192
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,330
去吧  別再犯罪了
Go, and sin no more.

193
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,730
不能再這樣下去了
This cannot continue.

194
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,120
他嘲弄我們的律法
He ridicules our laws,

195
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,210
侮辱我們祖宗的傳統
insults the traditions of our fathers.

196
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,610
我們苦苦奮斗來的一切
Everything that we have fought so hard for,

197
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,880
我們的信仰
our faith,

198
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,710
我們的社會
our communities,

199
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,770
神賜予我們的一切
everything God has given.

200
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,170
聖殿  耶路撒冷

201
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,520
-該亞法  -尼哥底母
- Caiaphas! - Nicodemus.

202
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,410
我聽說了一個年輕先知
I've had a report of a young prophet,

203
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,340
拿撒勒人耶穌
a Jesus of Nazareth.

204
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,320
他在加利利有一大批追隨者
He has a big following in Galilee.

205
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,540
傳聞說他會來耶路撒冷
It's rumored he'll come to Jerusalem.

206
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,370
加利利
Galilee?

207
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,930
-他能創造神跡  -都這麼吹
- He works miracles. - They all do.

208
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,540
尼哥底母  別擔心
Nicodemus, don't worry,

209
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,550
來自加利利的從來都是小事
nothing important ever came from Galilee!

210
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,900
加利利海

211
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,120
耶穌  耶穌
Jesus! Jesus!

212
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,970
這裡像個清靜地方
Looks like a quiet place.

213
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,650
可以了
That's it.

214
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,740
-栓上  -拉比  我來幫你
- Lock it off. - Rabbi, let me help you.

215
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,300
有幾千人之多
There are thousands of them.

216
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,520
這些都是追隨者
These are the followers.

217
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,360
他們歷經長途跋涉  天色不早了
They've come a long way. It's late.

218
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,950
他們說他們餓了
They say they're hungry.

219
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,740
給他們些食物
Give them food.

220
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,310
拿什麼給  
But how?

221
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,140
我們一無所有  只有些魚和餅
We have nothing. Just a few fish and some bread.

222
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,230
把它們給我
Bring them to me.

223
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,280
父  感謝你帶給我們的
Thank you, Father, for what you bring us.

224
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,620
我們的天父養活空中的飛鳥
Our father in heaven feeds the birds of the air.

225
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,460
更何況是你們，不是要給的更多嗎？
How much more will he give to you?

226
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,110
不用擔心日常所需  神會提供我們
Don't worry about daily needs, God will provide.

227
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,580
把神放在第一位  其他一切都將隨之而來
Put God first and everything else will follow.

228
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,920
倘若你渴望公義
If you hunger for righteousness,

229
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,410
你必會飽足，經由我
you will be filled through me.

230
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,280
他說我們祈求
He said ask...

231
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,410
就給我們
...and it will be given.

232
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,740
來自上帝的
From God.

233
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,450
上帝給的  這是上帝給的
From God. It's from God!

234
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,780
彌賽亞  彌賽亞
Messiah! Messiah!

235
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,280
彌賽亞  彌賽亞
Messiah! Messiah!

236
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,640
彌賽亞  彌賽亞
Messiah! Messiah!

237
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,350
他們希望你做他們的王  猶太人的王
They want you to be their king. King of the Jews!

238
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,370
你可以如軍隊般帶領我們
You can lead us like an army.

239
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,760
我們有能力擊敗羅馬人
We are strong enough to beat the Romans!

240
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,940
不  不應該透過這種方式
No, this is not the way.

241
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,690
不是透過武力
Not by force.

242
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,180
他要去哪兒  怎麼回事
Where is he going? What's wrong?

243
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,330
有五千人前往見他
Five thousand came to see him.

244
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,270
五千人
Five thousand.

245
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,760
現在他們高喊著 "彌賽亞"
Now they shout, "Messiah."

246
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,970
今天那些人民  他們稱你為"王"
The people today, they called you "King",

247
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,930
他們認為你是彌賽亞
they think you are a Messiah.

248
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,080
但你似乎沒理會他們
But you seemed to ignore them.

249
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,460
你不會做我們的王嗎
Aren't you going to be our king?

250
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,370
你們說我是誰
Who do you think I am?

251
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,900
你是神的兒子
You are the Son of God.

252
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,010
彼得  憑你自己的知識是不能說這話的
You can't have known this by what you know of me, Peter.

253
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,100
這是神啟示你的
It has been revealed to you by God.

254
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,560
你是彼得（磐石）
You are Peter,

255
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,430
我要把我的教會建造在這磐石上
and on this rock I will build my church.

256
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,540
明日我會在對岸等你們
Tomorrow I'll meet you on the other shore.

257
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,370
為何他要在我們日漸強盛時離開？
Why did he walk away just when we're getting strong?

258
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,560
彌賽亞是不會這樣離開我們的
Surely a Messiah wouldn't leave us like this.

259
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,660
彌賽亞應該是位勇士  
A Messiah should be a warrior,

260
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,280
像大衛一樣的征服者
a conqueror like David.

261
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,090
猶大  暴力不是解決的方式
Judas! Force is not the way.

262
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,970
那麼告訴我彌賽亞的方式什麼
So tell me what the way of the Messiah is?

263
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,820
他與眾不同
He's different.

264
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,450
但是馬利亞  倘若他不是彌賽亞呢
But Mary, what if he's not the one?

265
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,280
我們冒著生命危險  為了什麼
We're risking our lives, for what?

266
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,830
他展示給我們了他的能力  
He has shown us his power.

267
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,510
我們要對他有信心
We must have faith in him.

268
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,080
-來吧  -他不會讓我們失望
- Come on. - He'll not fail us.

269
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,670
他說他會在對面等我們  走吧
He said he'd meet us on the other side. Let's go!

270
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,690
把帆放下
Bring the sail down!

271
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,730
把東西都綁緊
Tie everything down!

272
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,500
這太危險了
This is too dangerous!

273
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,080
我們應趁來得及轉頭回去
We should turn back while we still can.

274
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,830
你也聽見他說的話了  他要我們能過去
You heard what he said, he wants us to cross.

275
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,080
那是什麼
What is that?

276
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,280
是鬼怪
It's a ghost!

277
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,710
不  多馬
No, Thomas.

278
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,300
是耶穌
It's Jesus.

279
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,580
他就是彌賽亞
He is the Messiah!

280
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,570
彼得
Peter...

281
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,090
彼得  你在做什麼
Peter, what are you doing?

282
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,010
不要怕
Don't be afraid.

283
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,380
過來
Come.

284
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,230
彼得
Peter!

285
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,190
不
No!

286
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,890
彼得
Peter...

287
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,060
你這小信的人哪
You of little faith.

288
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,570
為什麼疑惑呢
Why did you doubt?

289
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,990
你要堅信不移
You need to be strong.

290
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,840
拿撒勒

291
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,700
馬利亞  他回來了
Mary! He's here!

292
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,750
-誰  -耶穌  他終於回來了
- Who? - Jesus! He's back at last.

293
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,000
自從天使加百列造訪耶穌的母親
Ever since the Angel Gabriel came to Jesus' mother,

294
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,480
她就知曉了兒子真正的使命
she's known her son's true purpose.

295
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,370
現在  人們也即將知曉
It's time for others to learn.

296
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,300
耶穌在會堂裡朗誦了一段
In the synagogue, Jesus reads

297
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,240
當時廣為流傳的經文之一
from one of the most popular scriptures of the time,

298
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,110
該經文預言了彌賽亞的降臨
a prophecy describing the coming of the Messiah.

299
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,470
主的靈在我身上
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,

300
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,670
因為他用膏  膏我
because he has anointed me

301
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,180
叫我傳福音給貧窮的人
to preach good news to the poor.

302
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:43,530
差遣我報告被擄的得釋放
He has sent me to declare freedom for the captives,

303
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,570
瞎眼的得看見
and recovery of sight for the blind,

304
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,010
叫那受壓制的得自由
to set free those who are oppressed.

305
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,990
今天
Today...

306
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,340
這經文應驗了
...this scripture is fulfilled.

307
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,010
你說什麼
What are you saying?

308
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,260
你說什麼
What are you saying?

309
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,420
你說你已經做成這一切了？
That you have achieved all this?

310
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,010
你說你就是被上帝選中派來人間的彌賽亞嗎
That you are the Messiah, the chosen one sent by God?

311
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,820
不可能
No!

312
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,530
我是說你們應順從上帝的旨意
I'm saying you must accept God's word.

313
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,910
大膽  你這是褻瀆上帝
How dare you? That is sacrilege.

314
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,370
他從未修習過律法  無知得很
He has never studied the law. This man knows nothing!

315
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,260
他的醫治能力源自魔鬼
His healing is the work of demons!

316
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,980
預言開始應驗了
It has begun.

317
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,060
他破壞了我們的信仰
He undermines our faith!

318
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,460
-他甚至招募淫亂的信徒  -彼得
- He recruits adulterers... - Peter!

319
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,730
那邊的臉也由他打
Turn the other cheek.

320
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,270
你會為此付出代價
You'll pay the price for this!

321
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,530
正如你的朋友施洗約翰一樣
Like your friend, John the Baptist!

322
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,050
你還沒聽說吧
You haven't heard, have you?

323
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,410
他已被處死
He was executed.

324
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,610
身首異處
Beheaded!

325
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,670
-他是個好人  -是的  但卻死了
- He was a good man. - Yes, and now he's dead.

326
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,490
請為我施洗
Baptize me.

327
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,720
約翰是我見過最好的良師
John was the greatest teacher I ever knew.

328
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,940
他不僅僅是先知
He was more than a prophet.

329
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,710
我們還要繼續
Our work goes on.

330
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,140
過些日子我們就去耶路撒冷
Soon we go to Jerusalem.

331
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,250
耶路撒冷
Jerusalem?

332
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,810
-操之過急  -也太危險
- It's too soon. - It's too dangerous.

333
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,190
我們還沒預備
We're not ready.

334
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,130
猶大  我們為何聚集於此
Judas, why are we all here?

335
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,930
為了走康庄大道嗎
To take the easy path?

336
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,840
我們必須傳道於耶路撒冷
We must take the message to Jerusalem.

337
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,040
直搗權力核心
Right to the heart of power.

338
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,700
耶路撒冷  
彼拉多的宅邸

339
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,960
總督大人  我們需要您  有麻煩了
Prefect, you're needed. There's trouble.

340
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,850
羅馬渣滓  羅馬強盜  要他們好看
Roman scum! Roman thieves! Let's show them!

341
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,720
羅馬強盜
Roman thieves!

342
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,190
為大祭司讓路
Make way for the high priest!

343
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,930
為大祭司讓路
Make way for the high priest!

344
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,130
馬勒古  馬勒古  發生何事
Malchus! Malchus, what's happening?

345
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,790
又發生了抗議  大祭司
It's another protest, high priest.

346
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,380
我們得帶您離開這兒  抗議正演變成暴動
We need to get you out of here, it's turning into a riot.

347
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,340
將大人送回宅邸  越快越好
Get the master back to his residence. Quick as you can!

348
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,730
-怎麼回事  -是水溝惹的禍
- What is all this about? - The aqueduct.

349
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,250
羅馬人動用了我們的聖殿奉獻去挖水溝
The people are furious that the Romans used our temple funds

350
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,120
民眾非常憤怒
to build it.

351
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,100
上百民眾正要去向彼拉多告狀
Hundreds are heading to complain to Pilate.

352
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,040
什麼
What?

353
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,410
他們還沒靠近他就會被殺了！
He'll have them cut down before they can get anywhere near him.

354
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,880
他曾承諾會聽取民眾的不滿
He said he'd listen to their grievances.

355
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,590
這是個圈套  尼哥底母  你看不出來嗎
It's a trap, Nicodemus! Can't you see that?

356
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,380
盜賊  人渣
Thieves! Scum!

357
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,650
羅馬人渣
Roman scum!

358
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,400
耶路撒冷需要水  
Jerusalem needs water.

359
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,810
你們覺得水是你們的神帶來的嗎
You think your God brings it?

360
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,450
不  不是他
No, he does not.

361
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,870
是我們羅馬人帶來的
Rome does.

362
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,340
是時候讓你們明白
It's time you understood

363
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,160
你們的主人為你們做了什麼
what your masters do for you!

364
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,400
彼拉多這是要我們守本分
Pilate's keeping us in our place.

365
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,440
否則想想他會在逾越節做出什麼事來
Imagine what he could do at Passover.

366
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,730
伯大尼村

367
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,570
馬大  出什麼事了
Martha, what's wrong?

368
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,460
我兄弟死了
My brother is dead.

369
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,070
你來得太晚了
You're too late.

370
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,460
帶我去他的墓穴看看
Show me the tomb.

371
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,260
他死去多久了
How long has he been dead?

372
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,510
已經四天了
He's been there four days.

373
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,820
拉撒路...
Lazarus...

374
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,940
復活在我...
I am the resurrection...

375
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,000
生命也在我
...and the life.

376
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,140
信我的人...
Anyone who believes in me...

377
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,420
雖然死了...
...even if he dies...

378
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,600
也必復活
...he will still have life.

379
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,430
拉撒路
Lazarus!

380
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,930
我的兄弟啊
My brother, oh!

381
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:25,940
凡活著信我的人必永遠不死
Whoever believes in me shall never die.

382
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,360
你若信我就必看見神的榮耀
Believe in me and you will see the glory of God.

383
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,030
該亞法
Caiaphas!

384
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,360
有人說那個耶穌把一個死人救活了
They say this Jesus has raised a man from the dead.

385
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,690
什麼
What?

386
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,510
他會來耶路撒冷過逾越節
He will be here in Jerusalem for Passover.

387
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,490
不行
No.

388
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,770
但如果他與萬千擁護者相伴而來
But if he comes with thousands of supporters,

389
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,470
隨著慶祝節日的人們相繼到來
the city will already be breaking at the seams

390
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,970
這城將會人滿為患
with those arriving for the festival.

391
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,370
尼哥底母 你說得對
Nicodemus, you are right.

392
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,840
到時羅馬人就會插手了
The Romans will step in.

393
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,110
我們必須阻止這個神棍  這個騙子
We must not allow this miracle man, this fraud,

394
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,140
來破壞逾越節
to disrupt Passover.

395
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,460
這事彼拉多知道嗎
Does Pilate know?

396
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,160
《聖經》下集預告
Next time on the Bible

397
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,110
他現在在哪兒
Where is he now?

398
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,210
他剛騎著驢...進了城門
He's just entered the gate. On a donkey.

399
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,560
長官  一個猶太人正在聖殿裡制造麻煩
Sir, a Jew has been causing trouble in the temple.

400
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,580
-他說什麼  -所有廟石都不會再矗立
- He said what?  - Not one stone will be left standing.

401
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,810
毀了這殿  我會在三日之內重新建立起來
Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days.

402
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,880
如果一場騷亂
If the disturbances that took place a day

403
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,980
在第二天依然繼續的話
are repeated tomorrow,

404
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,670
我將立刻關閉聖殿
I will shut the temple immediately.

405
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,040
取消逾越節  
There will be no Passover.

406
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,740
整個城市實行宵禁
I will put this city under curfew.

407
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,110
我說得夠明白了嗎
Do I make myself absolutely clear?

408
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,520
你們只有一位父  就是天父
You only have one Father, and he is in heaven.

409
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,300
你們只有一位夫子  就是基督
You only have one Teacher, and he is the Christ.

410
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,260
就是那個人  那兒
That man, there.

411
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,020
他想要幫助我們
He wants to help us.

412
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,940
他可能會有用
That could be useful.

413
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,840
猶大
Judas.

414
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,110
你們找他有什麼事
What do you want with him?

415
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,800
就是談談
Just a talk.

416
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,530
這是我死前我們在一起的
This is our last meal together,

417
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,350
最後一餐了
before I die.

418
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,540
寬恕我
Spare me.

419
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,020
叛徒
Traitor.

420
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,300
快跑
Run!
