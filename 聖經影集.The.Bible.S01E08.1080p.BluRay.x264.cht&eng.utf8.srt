跟我走

約書亞帶領他的人民進入應許之地

大衛團結以色列人

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,130
奪下了耶路撒冷
and delivered the city of Jerusalem.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,000
但如今他們的後裔由羅馬統治
But now their descendants are ruled by Rome...

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,080
臣服於本丟．彼拉多之下
under Pontius Pilate.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,010
羅馬人渣  羅馬小偷
Roman scum! Roman thieves!

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,080
數百人正要去見彼拉多長官
Hundreds are heading to see the Prefect Pilate.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,870
什麼
What?

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,270
他們還未近他的身  就會成為亡魂
He'll have them cut down before they could get anywhere near him.

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,120
也該讓你們知道你們的主人為你們做了什麼
It's time you understood what your masters do for you.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,600
彼拉多殘殺了成百上千的猶太人
Pilate has already massacred hundreds of Jewish people.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,040
大祭司該亞法深感再多的騷亂
High Priest Caiaphas feels any further disorder

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,940
只會讓彼拉多繼續殺戮

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,550
或者關閉聖殿
Or shut the temple.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,530
在加利利省
In the province of Galilee,

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,670
耶穌已經引起轟動
Jesus has already been making waves.

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,140
倘若你渴望公義
If you hunger for righteousness,

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,020
跟隨我  你們必將達成所願
you will be filled... through me.

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,800
我聽說了一個年輕先知  
I've had a report of a young prophet,

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,660
拿撒勒人耶穌
 Jesus of Nazareth.

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,130
在加利利  有很多人跟從他
He has a big following in Galilee.

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
他能創造神跡

甚至能起死回生
and has even raised the dead.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,550
很多人都相信  他就是彌賽亞
Thousands believe he is the Messiah.

40
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,320
他們希望你能為他們的王
They want you to be their king,

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,080
猶太人的王
king of the Jews.

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,920
你能像帶領軍隊一般引領我們
You can lead us like an army.

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,130
動用武力不是解決辦法  
This is not the way, not by force.

44
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
耶穌和他的跟隨者
Now Jesus and his followers...

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,040
正前往權力的中心  耶路撒冷
are heading to the center of power- Jerusalem.

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,170
加利利彌賽亞的出現
The Messiah from Galilee

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,290
和耶路撒冷逾越節的時間如此接近
and Jerusalem of Passover have time near.

48
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,000
彼拉多知道嗎
Does Pilate know?

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,470
聖經

50
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,270
禮拜日
逾越節前一周

51
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,560
逾越節是猶太人一年中最重要的節日
Passover is the biggest Jewish festival of the year.

52
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,140
成千上萬的人來到耶路撒冷感謝上帝
Thousands come to Jerusalem to thank God...

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,770
解救他們的祖先擺脫埃及人的奴役
for releasing their ancestors from Egyptian slavery.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,260
看  是耶穌  彌賽亞
Look! It's Jesus! The Messiah!

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,500
帶上棕樹枝  彌賽亞  彌賽亞
Bring those palms! Messiah! Messiah!

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,440
耶穌進城在群眾中掀起了狂潮
Jesus ' entrance creates a storm.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,780
他在那兒  他來了  和散那  和散那
There he is! There he is! Hosanna! Hosanna!

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,570
和散那  和散那
Hosanna! Hosanna!

59
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,910
先知撒迦利亞曾預言  猶太人的新王
The prophet Zechariah predicted that a new king of the Jews...

60
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,430
將騎著驢進城
would enter the city on a donkey.

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,760
和散那
Hosanna!

62
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,840
和散那  和散那
Hosanna! Hosanna!

63
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,950
他現在在哪兒
Where is he now?

64
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,570
他剛騎著驢進了城
He's just entered the city on a donkey.

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,940
瞧  你們的王來了
See, your king comes to you,

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,700
一身正氣  凱旋而來  而且謙卑有禮
righteous and victorious, humble...

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,240
還是騎著驢進城的
and riding on a donkey.

68
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,040
他要去哪裡
Where is he headed?

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,010
朝聖殿而去
Towards the temple.

70
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,840
這個來自加利利的擾亂者是個麻煩
This agitator from Galilee- he's trouble.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,860
群眾呢  有什麼反應
The crowds- how are they responding?

72
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,170
羅馬人呢  有采取行動嗎
And the Romans, have they made any move yet?

73
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,700
-沒有  -遲早的事罷了
-No. -Hmm. Well, so far.

74
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,690
決不能讓他在逾越節搗亂
He must not interfere with Passover.

75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,110
上帝會將他的忿怒降在所有人身上
God will bring his wrath down upon all of us.

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,990
如果群眾失控
And... who knows what Pilate will do...

77
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,700
誰知道彼拉多會做出什麼
if the crowds run out of control.

78
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,140
尼哥底母  和馬勒古一起去
Nicodemus, go with Malchus.

79
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,430
如果他進入聖殿  好好看著他
If he enters the temple, watch him.

80
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,400
好好看著
Do not blink.

81
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,050
我要知道一切情況  去吧
I need to know everything. Go.

82
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,640
天國就要來了
The kingdom is coming!

83
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,960
天國就要來了  這可是彌賽亞
The kingdom is coming! Messiah!

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,130
那是巴拉巴
That's Barabbas.

85
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,770
彌賽亞
Messiah!

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,450
以色列的王
King of Israel,

87
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,810
你為什麼不解救我們
why don't you make us free?

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,150
主啊  拯救我們遠離羅馬人
Save us from the Romans, Lord.

89
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,530
我們帶著和平而來  巴拉巴
We come in peace, Barabbas.

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,010
和散那  和散那
Hosanna! Hosanna!

91
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,180
和散那  和散那
Hosanna! Hosanna!

92
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,030
讓開
Move.

93
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,040
閃開
Get out of the way!

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,380
退開
Get back!

95
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,620
聖殿是聖經之中最為神聖的地方
The temple is the holiest place in the Bible.

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,930
在節日裡
During festival times,

97
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,120
買賣獻祭的動物和兌換銀錢的交易
selling sacrificial animals and changing money...

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,020
十分興旺
has become a thriving business.

99
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,670
我來換換你這兒的錢
Change your money here!

100
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,150
二  五
Two, five-

101
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,540
都來這換吧
All change here!

102
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,880
換錢的到這裡
Exchange here!

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,690
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

104
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,530
耶穌  別這樣
Jesus, please.

105
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,480
經上不是記著說
Is it not written-

106
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,580
慢著
Wait.

107
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
經上不是記著說
Is it not written-

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,660
"我的殿"
"My house-"

109
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,330
"我的殿必稱為萬國禱告的殿"嗎
"My house shall be called the house of prayer"?

110
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,270
但是你們
But you,

111
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,760
你們倒使他成為賊窩了
you have made it a den of thieves.

112
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,330
你是誰  有何資格這樣說教我們
Who are you to tell us this?

113
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,770
教律法的是我們  而不是你
We teach the law, not you.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
你們只為身份高貴者禱告
You pray lofty prayers...

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,180
在聖殿之中裝出虔誠的模樣
and love your shows of piety in the temple.

116
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,500
假冒為善的人啊
Hypocrites.

117
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,710
你們不能事奉主的同時
You cannot serve God...

118
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,740
又事奉金錢
and money.

119
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,770
這太可惡了
This is outrageous.

120
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,100
你們卻什麼忙都幫不上
And you were little help.

121
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,220
他很聰明
He's clever.

122
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,480
民眾都尊崇他
The crowd worship him.

123
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,420
他有點不尋常
There is something unusual about him.

124
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,340
沒什麼不尋常的
There is nothing unusual about him,

125
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,350
除了有搞破壞的本事之外
apart from his ability to cause havoc.

126
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,040
如果他回來了  向他挑戰
If he returns, challenge him.

127
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,140
讓他的追隨們瞧瞧  他們的
Make his supporters see their Messiah...

128
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,520
是個頭腦多麼簡單的鄉下人
for the simpleminded peasant that he is.

129
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,450
星期一  
距逾越節四天

130
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,240
逾越節前的一星期
In the week leading up to Passover,

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,490
猶太朝聖者們每天都來聖殿朝拜
Jews pilgrims visit the temple daily.

132
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,860
為窮人們捐錢吧
Ounce for the poor.

133
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,980
上帝保佑你
God bless you!

134
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,240
耶穌也回來了
Jesus also returns,

135
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,290
告誡更多的人
to preach to ever larger crowds.

136
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,220
比起一個財主
It's much harder for a rich person

137
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,600
進入神的王國
to enter the kingdom of God,

138
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,930
駱駝穿過針的眼
than it is,

139
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,900
還要更容易些呢
for a carmel to go through the eye of a needle.

140
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,400
最重要的是
The most important thing...

141
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,000
你應該像愛你自己一樣
is that you should love your neighbor...

142
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,030
愛你的鄰居
as you love yourself.

143
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,570
夫子
Teacher!

144
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,040
他們說你學識淵博  那麼告訴我們
They say you are learned. So tell us.

145
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,520
我們應該向羅馬人交稅嗎
Should we pay taxes to the Romans?

146
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,990
不
No!

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,150
圈套
It's a trap.

148
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,090
夫子
Well, teacher,

149
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,960
我們應該向羅馬人交稅嗎
should we... pay the Romans taxes...

150
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,060
不交  不交
Not pay! Not pay!

151
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,770
不交
Not pay!

152
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,650
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

153
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,050
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

154
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,000
以色列
Israel!

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,090
告訴他
Tell him!

156
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,410
硬幣上的像是誰的
Whose face is on the coin?

157
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,720
是凱撒的
Caesar's.

158
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,650
那麼凱撒的物
Then give to Caesar...

159
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,890
當歸給凱撒
what is Caesar's...

160
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,580
神的物
and give to God...

161
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,990
當歸給神
what is God's.

162
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,180
大祭司  那個跟耶穌在一起的人
High Priest, that man there with Jesus,

163
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,430
他來找過我
he approached me.

164
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,260
他想幫我們
He wants to help us.

165
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,450
真的嗎  或許真用得上
Really? That could be useful.

166
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,020
你讓他占了上風
You let him get the better of you.

167
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,090
但我可能已經找到了對付他的辦法
Yet I may have found a way to deal with him.

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,550
星期三  
距逾越節兩天

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,550
要順從
Teachers of the law,

170
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,020
律法師
obey them.

171
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,010
凡他們所吩咐你們的  你們都要遵行
Do everything they tell you,

172
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,390
但不要效法他們的行為
but don't do what they do.

173
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,300
因為他們能說不能行
They don't practice what they preach.

174
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,320
他們一切所作的事  都是要叫人看見
Everything they do is done for others to see.

175
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,630
只有一位是你們的父
You only have one father,

176
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,060
就是在天上的父
and he is in heaven.

177
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,430
只有一位是你們的師尊
You only have one teacher,

178
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,450
他...
and he...

179
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,990
就是基督
is the Christ.

180
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,060
以色列  以色列
Israel! Israel!

181
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,310
你看見這些雄偉的殿宇了嗎
Do you see all these great buildings?

182
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,280
將來在這裡
Not one stone of this place,

183
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,910
沒有一塊石頭是不被拆毀的
not one stone, will be left standing.

184
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,590
他說他要拆毀聖殿
He said he'll destroy the temple.

185
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,420
他說什麼
He said what?

186
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,280
將來沒有一塊石頭是不被拆毀的
Not one stone will be left standing.

187
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,530
他威脅說要拆毀聖殿
He threatens to destroy the temple.

188
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,760
我們必須迅速行動  而且不能聲張
We must move swiftly but softly.

189
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,500
我們不能公開抓捕他
We can not arrest him openly,

190
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,700
否則他的擁護者會暴動
or his his supporters will run riot.

191
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,970
不  不能在逾越節  不行
No, not on Passover. No.

192
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,250
不
No.

193
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,340
我們必須在逾越節前夜
We must bring him in quietly...

194
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,580
把他悄悄帶過來
at night before Passover.

195
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,720
馬勒古  你指給我看的
Malchus, what's the name of that

196
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,760
那個追隨者叫什麼
follower of his that you pointed out to me?

197
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,090
猶大  大祭司
Judas, High Priest.

198
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,080
猶大  是啊
Judas. Yes.

199
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,650
把他帶到這來見我  
Bring him to me... here.

200
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,870
彼拉多宅邸

201
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,150
大人
Sir.

202
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,530
我們在吃飯呢
We're eating.

203
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,960
大人  有個猶太人在聖殿裡制造麻煩
Sir, a Jew has been causing trouble in the temple.

204
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,850
所以呢
So?

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,410
昨天他攻擊了兌換銀錢的人
Yesterday he attacked the money changers.

206
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,640
今天他又說要拆毀聖殿
Today he says he will destroy the temple.

207
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,110
他有眾多擁護者
He has a large number of supporters.

208
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,630
他叫什麼
What's his name?

209
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,960
他們稱他拿撒勒人耶穌
They call him Jesus of Nazareth.

210
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,860
我的僕人談起過他
My servants talk about him.

211
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,290
那是該亞法的事
He's Caiaphas' business.

212
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,100
但你要密切注意民眾的情況
But you keep an eye on the crowds.

213
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,680
若事態失控  我就關閉聖殿
If they start to get out of hand, I'll shut the temple.

214
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,060
管他是不是過節
Festival or no festival.

215
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,910
拉比
Rabbi.

216
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,400
我是尼哥底母
I am Nicodemus.

217
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
歡迎
Welcome.

218
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,310
我自願前來
I come here of my own accord.

219
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,040
大祭司並不知情
The High Priest knows nothing of this.

220
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,390
他來這裡幹嘛
What's he doing here?

221
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,730
顯然他不願意和我們同坐
Surely he doesn't want to sit with us.

222
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,190
猶大
Judas.

223
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,900
你那位來自加利利的朋友
Your friend from Galilee

224
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,660
引起了好一陣轟動啊
has caused quite a stir.

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
沒人能否認他有眾多追隨者
One cannot deny that he has followers,

226
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,230
尤其是一些沒怎麼受過教育的人
especially amongst the less well-educated element.

227
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,970
但你  猶大
But you, Judas-

228
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,950
我倒是很好奇
I'm intrigued.

229
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,980
他
He-

230
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,450
他有一種能力
He has a power.

231
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,470
很難用言語形容
It's hard for me to put into words.

232
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,770
他的能力就是制造麻煩
A power to cause trouble,

233
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,340
引起騷亂
to stir things up.

234
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,980
攻擊兌換銀錢之人
Attacking money changers.

235
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,300
威脅要拆毀聖殿
Threatening to destroy the temple-

236
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,460
那是我們的至聖所
the Holy of Holies.

237
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,420
如果他真是...
If he were...

238
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,870
神子
the Son of God-

239
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,550
如果
lf.

240
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,010
他會折辱神的聖殿嗎
Would he abuse the house of God?

241
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,750
真正的彌賽亞
The true Messiah...

242
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,830
會團結以色列  而非使其分裂
will unite Israel, not divide it.

243
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,430
你想對他怎麼樣
What do you want with him?

244
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,760
談談而已
Just to talk.

245
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,270
如果羅馬人介入此事
If the Romans step in,

246
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,900
你能想象那時的殺戮嗎
can you imagine the slaughter?

247
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,170
那將意味著聖殿的毀滅
It will mean the end of the temple,

248
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,230
信仰的毀滅
the end of our faith,

249
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,350
以及國家的終結
the end of our nation.

250
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,050
你想這樣嗎  猶大
Is that what you want, Judas?

251
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,740
猶大  你是他的朋友
Judas, you are his friend.

252
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,350
把他帶到這來  小心行事
Bring him here... discreetly.

253
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,800
讓我們共同阻止這一切
Let us try to stop this...

254
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,560
趁現在還來得及
while we still can.

255
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,950
那我有什麼好處
And what's in it for me?

256
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,530
很好
Good.

257
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,550
希望很快就能聽到你的好消息
We shall expect to hear from you presently.

258
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,330
他們說你能創造神跡
They say you can perform miracles,

259
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,390
說你見過神的國
that you have seen the kingdom of God.

260
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,350
你也能看見神的國
You can see the kingdom of God.

261
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,250
但你必須重生
But you must be born again.

262
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,000
重生  如何能重生
Born again? How can you be... born again?

263
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,890
你必須獲得新生
You must be reborn.

264
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,560
不是你的肉體
Not in the flesh,

265
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,120
而是你的靈
but in a spirit.

266
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,240
風隨著意思吹
The wind blows where it wishes.

267
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,720
你不曉得它從哪裡來
You don't k now where it comes from...

268
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,750
往哪裡去
or where it goes.

269
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,700
凡從聖靈生的  也是如此
And so it is when the Spirit enters you.

270
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,070
神
God...

271
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,370
愛世人
so loved the world...

272
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,900
甚至將他的獨生子賜給他們
that he gave his one and only son.

273
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,730
叫信他的人
Believe in him,

274
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,160
不至滅亡  反得永生
and you will have eternal life.

275
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,310
星期四
逾越節前一天

276
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,640
隨著逾越節愈發臨近
The closer it gets to Passover,

277
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,060
耶路撒冷局勢更加緊張
the tenser it gets in Jerusalem.

278
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,580
就在三十年前
Just 30 years ago,

279
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,500
羅馬人在逾越節游行期間殺害了數千人
the Romans killed thousands during Passover demonstrations.

280
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,000
羅馬盜賊  羅馬人渣
Roman thieves! Roman scum!

281
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,120
羅馬盜賊
Roman thieves!

282
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,560
羅馬盜賊  羅馬人渣
Roman thieves! Roman scum!

283
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,420
羅馬人渣
Roman scum!

284
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,030
場面太混亂了
This is a mess.

285
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,760
我必須通知彼拉多
I must inform Pilate.

286
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,250
從我擔任總督以來
Since I 've been prefect,

287
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,870
你們猶太人多次挑戰我耐心的底線
you Jews have tested my patience to breaking point.

288
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,620
現在我已忍無可忍  
Now I 'm beyond it.

289
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,990
是的  但是  總督大人
Yes, but, prefect-

290
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,200
我正在說話
I'm speaking.

291
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,260
倘若動亂在明日再次發生  
If disturbance took places a day and repeated tomorrow.

292
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,660
我會立即關閉聖殿
I will shut the temple immediately.

293
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,350
逾越節將被取消
There will be no Passover.

294
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,680
整個城市實行宵禁
I will put this city under curfew.

295
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,570
鎮壓一切叛亂
I will crush any rebellion.

296
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,170
我說得夠明白了嗎
Do I make myself absolutely clear?

297
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,120
主  我們感謝你
We thank you, Lord,

298
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,350
感謝你創造世間一切
by whose word everything comes to be.

299
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,860
阿門
Amen.

300
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,780
這是我死前  我們一起吃的
This is our last meal together...

301
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,320
最後一餐
before I die.

302
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,510
什麼意思
What do you mean?

303
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,600
我會被人出賣給我的敵人
I 'm going to be betrayed to my enemies.

304
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,800
被逮捕
Arrested...

305
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,300
並處以死刑
and condemned to death.

306
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,020
馬勒古  猶太有什麼消息嗎
Malchus, any word from Judas?

307
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,430
沒有  大祭司
Nothing, High Priest.

308
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,360
我不會再等了
I won't wait any longer.

309
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,790
馬勒古  我們今晚就把這個假先知抓起來
Malchus, we arrest this false prophet tonight.

310
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,650
我們怎麼知道他是假先知
How do we know he is a false prophet?

311
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,480
他符合
Has he fulfilled...

312
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,970
我們經文中所描述的
any of the signs of a true Messiah

313
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,030
真正的彌賽亞的特征嗎
as written in our scriptures?

314
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,280
尼哥底母  他符合嗎
Well, Nicodemus, has he?

315
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,220
他將依據我們的律法受審
He will be tried according to our law.

316
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,590
我們得除掉他  否則羅馬人會毀滅一切
We remove this man or the Romans destroy everything.

317
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,760
除掉
Remove?

318
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,070
處死
Execute?

319
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,410
沒錯  尼哥底母
Yes, Nicodemus.

320
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,020
用這個鄉下人的命
The life of one peasant...

321
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,370
換取上帝之國的未來
for the future of God's nation.

322
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,830
你們不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

323
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,470
要相信上帝
Trust in God.

324
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,090
也要相信我
Trust in me also.

325
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,950
我要去的地方  你們知道怎麼走
You know the way to where I'm going.

326
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,240
我們都不知道你往哪裡去  
We don't know where you are going,

327
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,160
怎麼會認得路呢
how can we know the way?

328
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,520
我就是道路
I am the way,

329
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,600
真理
the truth...

330
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,340
和生命
and the life.

331
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,770
拿去
Take it.

332
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,070
吃吧
Eat.

333
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,330
這
This-

334
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,810
這是我的身體
This is my body.

335
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,100
這是我的血
This is my blood.

336
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,860
通過這樣
Remember me...

337
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,750
記住我
by doing this.

338
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,520
我要去天父那裡了
I'm going to the Father.

339
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,080
但我將一直與你們同在
But I will always be with you.

340
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,200
現在我要告訴你們
But now I must tell you...

341
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,880
你們中間有一個人
that one of you here...

342
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,110
要賣我了
will betray me.

343
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:40,910
是誰
Who?

344
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,150
那個吃了它的人
Whoever eats this.

345
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,440
我不會  我不會出賣你的

346
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,310
快做吧

347
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,690
讓他走
Let him go.

348
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
今夜你們都要跌倒
You will all fall away.

349
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,310
拉比
Rabbi.

350
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,910
我永不跌倒
I will not fall away.

351
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,660
我願意為你舍命
I will lay down my life for you.

352
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,430
你真願意嗎
Will you?

353
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
我願意
I will.

354
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,290
彼得
Peter,

355
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,870
我要告訴你
I tell you...

356
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,660
雞叫以先
before dawn,

357
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,040
你要三次不認我
you will deny me...three times.

358
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,200
猶大  他在哪
Judas. Where is he?

359
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,000
-我...  -你究竟知不知道他在哪
- I... - Do you know where he is now?

360
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,040
我知道他會去哪
I know where he's going.

361
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,050
帶我的侍從找到他

362
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,340
客西馬尼花園

363
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,280
醒醒
Wake up.

364

別睡著了
And keep awake.

365
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,760
時辰已到
The time has come.

366
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,490
你們心靈固然願意  肉體卻軟弱了
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

367
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,890
我必須要禱告
I must pray.

368
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,990
我父啊
Father.

369
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,730
我父啊

都照你的旨意
as you will it.

373
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,600
父啊  帶走我的靈魂吧
Father, take this from me.

374
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,800
寬恕我
Spare me.

375
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,560
神啊  你定會滿意我的所為

376
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,930
因你一直誠心扶持我
For you sustain me in sincerity.

377

感謝你們  我們的祖先

阿們  阿們
Amen and amen.

384
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,640
如果這是你的旨意  父啊
If you will it, Father.

385
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,850
如果這是你的旨意
If you will it,

386
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,580
我必完成
your will...

387
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,760
你的旨意
is mine.

388
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,970
你來要作的事  就作吧
Do what you came for.

389
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,880
叛徒
Traitor!

390
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,740
抓住他  抓住他

凡動刀的
He who lives by the sword...

398
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,310

402
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,040

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,790
滾遠點
Get out of here!

接著走  別停下
Keep him moving.

414
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,020
叫你口出狂言
We'll teach you to blaspheme.

415
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,410
過來
Come on!

416
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,970
-告訴該亞法我們抓到耶穌了  -是
- Tell Caiaphas we have Jesus. - Yes, sir.

417
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,730
你不用跟了

418
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,230
"因此夜間的審判包括死刑
"Therefore night trials involving death penalty

419
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,640
不得在安息日前夜
may not be held on the eve of Sabbath...

420
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,230
或是其他宗教節日前夜進行"
or on the eve of a feast day."

421
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,440
首席辯士說
The best scholar say

422
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,300
審判只能在白晝進行
we must hold our trials by daylight.

423
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,170
但我們今晚就審判
But the trial is tonight.

424
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,180
你不能這麼幹
You cannot go through with this.

425
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,560
這不合法
It is not legal.

426
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,660
我們的辯士說
Our scholar say

427
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,150
審判必須在白天在法庭上公開進行
it must be in court, in daylight, in public!

428
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,200
必須這麼做
It is necessary.

429
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,880
為什麼要這麼趕
Why the rush?

430
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,320
你明知道的
You know why.

431
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,260
彼拉多會關閉聖殿
Pilate will close the temple.

432
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,160
我們必須除掉這個耶穌
We must be rid of this Jesus.

433
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,400
如果他真的是人們所說的那個人呢
But what if he really is who they say he is?

434
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,130
我們會准確地判斷這事的
We are to decide precisely that.

435
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,320
現在  按上帝指引的做
now, with God's guidance.

436
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,230
上帝要求我們遵守律法
God demands we obey the law.

437
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,070
那我提醒你  律法是這麼寫的
Let me remind you what the law says.

438
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,020
任何對祭司或審判表示蔑視的人
Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest...

439
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
格殺勿論
shall be put to death.

440
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,130
任何人
Anyone.

441
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,210
告訴我
Tell me.

442
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,280
請告訴我
Speak to me.

443
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,770
為什麼放任他們如此對你
Why letting them do this to you?

444
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,180
別再向前了  退下
No, no, no. Get back.

445
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,970
看到那個被捕的人了嗎
Have you seen the man they arrested?

446
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,200
-看到那個被捕的人了嗎  -退下
- Have you seen the man they arrested?  -Get back.

447
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,870
同胞們
Brothers.

448
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,050
感謝各位深夜前來
Thank you for coming at this hour.

449
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,540
如果不是要緊事
You know I would not have asked you...

450
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,900
我也不會如此興師動眾
if it were not so serious.

451
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,980
讓他起來
Get him up.

452
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,930
拿撒勒人耶穌
Jesus of Nazareth,

453
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,940
你被指控褻瀆上帝
you are charged with blasphemy.

454
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,030
馬利亞
Mary?

455
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,540
馬利亞
Mary.

456
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,150
出什麼事了  我的兒子呢
What has happened? Where is my son?

457
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,880
耶穌被捕了
Jesus has been arrested.

458
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,790
被捕
Arrested?

459
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,940
但我們不知道他被抓到哪去了
But we don't know where they have taken him.

460
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,560
被捕
Arrested?

461
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,410
在夜裡嗎
At night?

462
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,870
他們是秘密行動
They want to keep it secret.

463
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,000
不希望引起民眾抗議
They don't want any protests.

464
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:28,000
他利用魔鬼的力量去治愈疾病
He has employed demons... to heal.

465
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,200
他還威脅說
He has threatened...

466
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,530
要摧毀上帝的聖殿
to destroy the temple of our Lord.

467
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,130
同胞們  在審判之前
Brothers, we must listen...

468
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,780
我們必須傾聽
before we judge.

469
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,420
所以  我請先知來
And so I invite the prophet...

470
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,080
說一說
to speak.

471
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,120
請告訴我們  上帝向你傳達的話
Tell us the message you bring from God.

472
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,680
沒有嗎
Nothing?

473
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,290
無話可說嗎  當然
Nothing to say? Surely.

474
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,430
告訴我們
Tell us this.

475
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,300
你是不是天選之子
Are you... the Chosen One?

476
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,230
你是不是神子
Are you the Son of God?

477
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,680
我是
I am.

478
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,730
你們將會看見人子
And you will see me coming...

479
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,730
駕著天上的雲降臨
with the clouds of heaven,

480
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,850
坐在那權能者的右邊
sitting at the right hand of God.

481
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,200
真是無法容忍
This is repulsive!

482
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,970
和上帝一起  騙子
With God? Impostor!

483
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,330
蠢材  僭妄者
Fool! Blasphemer!

484
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,320
大家都聽見了
We have heard enough.

485
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,230
裁決結果只有一個
There is only one verdict.

486
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,580
他有罪嗎
Guilty?

487
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,160
這是不對的
This is wrong.

488
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,050
這給我們的公會帶來恥辱
This brings shame on our council.

489
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,930
不是嗎
Does it not?

490
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,100
同胞們
Brothers.

491
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,320
此人被判處死刑
The sentence is death.

492
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,190
《聖經》下集預告
Next time on The Bible.

493
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,170
長官  我們需要您的幫助
Prefect, we need your help.

494
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,500
我們判決了一名非常危險的犯人
We have convicted a dangerous criminal.

495
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,290
他活一日  就是一日的威脅
He is an immediate threat.

496
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,860
他叫什麼
His name.

497
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,390
拿撒勒人耶穌
Jesus of Nazareth.

498
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,240
你是猶太人的王嗎
Are you the king of the Jews?

499
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,340
我的國
My kingdom...

500
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,950
不屬於這世界
is not of this world.

501
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,630
此人不過是有被人蠱惑了
He's guilty of nothing more than being deluded.

502
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,810
他侵犯了我們神聖的律法
He has broken our sacred laws.

503
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,510
拿撒勒人耶穌被判有罪
Jesus of Nazareth has been found guilty.

504
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,200
拿回你們的臭錢吧
Take back your money!

505
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,920
你認識他  你稱他拉比
You know him. You called him Rabbi.

506
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,580
我不認識此人
He's nothing to do with me.

507
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,530
他們會殺了他的
They're going to kill him.

508
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,940
釘死他
Crucify him!

509
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,650
你必因此事後悔終生
You'll live to regret this.

510
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,590
一周之後就沒人會記得他是誰了
He'll be forgotten in a week.

511
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,010
你本應是他的磐石
You were supposed to be his rock.

512
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,160
我辜負了他  如今也無法請求他的原諒
I failed him. Now I can't ask him to forgive me.

513
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,070
父啊
Father.

514
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,680
赦免他們
Forgive them...

515
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,240
因為他們所作的  他們不曉得
for they know not what they do.
