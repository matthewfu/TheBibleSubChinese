從那之後  該隱殺了亞伯

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,900
上帝目睹了人類內心深處太多的惡念

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,680
上帝同我說話了

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,710
他將指引我們去新的家園

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,350
他保證我的後裔會多如繁星

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,250

上帝派我回來  釋放你們得自由

主帶我們離開了埃及
The Lord brought us out from Egypt.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,600
他承諾將賜予我們這片土地
He promised us this land!

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,900
很快  它就會是我們的了

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,770

19
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,020
上帝已經拋棄你了

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,010
他想找一個合他心意的人

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,900
我相信您的兒子必是其子民未來的王
I believe your son is the promised king of his people.

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,010
他叫什麼名字
What is his name?

23
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,660
耶穌
Jesus.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,260
他的名字是耶穌

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,930
即將到來的那一位  大過我
There is one to come, greater than me,

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,940
我不過是曠野中的吶喊   做好準備迎接
I am just the voice in the wilderness, preparing the way for the...

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,080

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,410
-過些日子我們就去耶路撒冷  -太危險了

- Where is he headed? - Towards the temple, High Priest.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,630
上帝會將他的忿怒降在所有人身上
God will bring his wrath down upon all of us,

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,700
誰知道彼拉多會做什麼
and who knows what Pilate will do?

33
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,840
大人  有個猶太人最近在聖殿裡惹麻煩
Sir, a Jew has been causing trouble in the temple.

34
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,540
上帝和金錢  你無法兩者都事奉
You cannot serve God and money.

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,880
倘若動亂在明日再次發生

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,220
我會立即關閉聖殿

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,650
毀了這殿  我會在三日之內重新建立起來
Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,520
他還威脅說要摧毀聖殿
He has threatened to destroy the temple.

39
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,610
我們得除掉他  否則羅馬人會毀滅一切
We remove this man, or the Romans destroy everything.

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,610
-處死  -沒錯
- Execute? - Yes.

41
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,620
犧牲這平民的命
The life of one peasant...

42
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,620
換取上帝之國的未來
for the future of God's nation.

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,320
我不會離開你

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,680
彼得  你要三次說不認得我

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,350
告訴該亞法我們抓到耶穌了

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,330
-耶穌被捕了  -被捕

49
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,060
-你是不是神的兒子  -我是

逾越節的聖衣  大祭司
Your Passover robes, High Priest.

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,420
這是要判死刑的  但不能用石頭打死
The sentence is death, but it cannot be by stoning.

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,050
褻瀆神的懲罰自該如此
It's the penalty for blasphemy.

69
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,500
群眾中
The crowds-

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
有很多是他的支持者
He has thousands of supporters.

71
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,670
事態很容易失控  我不敢冒這個險
It could be disastrous. I dare not risk it.

72
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,980
彼拉多
Pilate.

73
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,850
讓彼拉多殺他  他有這權利
Pilate can do it. He has the authority.

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,140
可是羅馬要以什麼理由處死耶穌
Why would the Romans execute Jesus?

75
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,110
彼拉多奉命保證猶太地區的安全
Pilate is charged with keeping peace in Judaea.

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,070
這是共同利益
It's in our common interest.

77
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,410
我得讓他明白這一點
I must make him see that.

78
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,580
在此公告   長老院經過庭審後認為
Let it be known, Jesus of Nazareth has been tried

79
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,330
拿撒勒人耶穌
by the supreme court of elders,

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,610
褻瀆神的罪名成立
and he has been found guilty of blasphemy...

81
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,910
威脅損毀聖殿罪名成立
and of threatening to destroy the temple.

82
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,120
你們要他做什麼
What do you want with him?

83
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,580
就是談談
Just to talk.

84
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,500
判刑為...
The sentence...

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,980
死刑
is death.

86
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,000
你  還你錢
You! Take back your money!

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,830
你
You.

88

我見過你  你認識他
I've seen you before. You know him.

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,050
不
No.

90

我不認識他
I don't know him.

91
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,140
你管他叫拉比
You called him Rabbi.

92
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,440
他跟我沒關系
He has nothing to do with me.

93
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,990
你認識他  我見過你倆在一起
You know him, I've seen you with him.

94
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,980
我不認識他
I don't know him.

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,750
彼得
Peter,

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,660
你要三次說不認得我
you will deny me three times.

97
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,360
別怕
Don't be afraid.

98
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,400
帶他去彼拉多那裡
Take him to Pilate.

99
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,360
我的妻子呢  已經很晚了
Where's my wife? It's late.

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,220
主人  請快來
Please master, come quickly!

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,640
革老底亞  怎麼了
Claudia, what?

102
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
我
I-

103
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,880
我在夢裡
I saw a man...

104
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,280
見到一個人
in a dream.

105
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,770
被毆打...
A man being beaten...

106
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,980
然後被殺
and killed.

107
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,880
他是無辜的
An innocent man!

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,980
是聖人
A holy man.

109
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,010
是個好人
A good man.

110
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,800
-把她扶上床  -不
- Help your lady back to bed. - No.

111
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,030
殺他的人  是你
It was you who killed him.

112
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,050
你們中有一位
One of you here...

113
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,050
將出賣我
will betray me.

114
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,810
大祭司該亞法和長老們來見你了
Sir, the High Priest Caiaphas and the elders are here to see you.

115
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,110
總督大人  早上好
Prefect, good morning.

116
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,820
總督大人  我們需要你的幫助
Prefect, we need your help.

117
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,470
我們已將一個危險犯人緝拿歸案
We have convicted a dangerous criminal.

118
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,500
他必須被判死刑
His sentence must be death.

119
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,300
那就處死他
So? Execute him.

120
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,540
我們不能
We cannot.

121
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,040
逾越節如此臨近
This close to Passover,

122
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,270
會使我們看起來不聖潔
it would make us impure.

123
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,790
那就逾越節過後再處決
So do it after Passover.

124
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,210
他是個直接威脅
He is an immediate threat...

125
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,810
不僅對我們  也是對你
not only to us, but to you.

126
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,390
現在局勢緊張
This is a tense time...

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,720
我的子民在慶祝他們
when my people celebrate...

128
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,070
擺脫了上任欺壓者的魔爪
their deliverance from past oppressors.

129
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
他自稱為王
He claims to be our king...

130
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,680
煽動眾人一起反抗
and is whipping up the crowds into a rebellion,

131
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,090
這場反抗能把耶路撒冷搞得四分五裂
a rebellion that could tear Jerusalem apart.

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,180
該撒不會高興的
Caesar would not be pleased.

133
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,460
-他的名字  -拿撒勒人耶穌
- His name. - Jesus of Nazareth.

134
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,010
你最好別浪費我時間
You better not be wasting my time.

135
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,710
我會去見那犯人
I'll see the prisoner.

136
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,850
你  請停下
You! Stop, please.

137
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,050
請等等  求你了
Please wait! Please!

138
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,620
你認識耶穌  你和他說過話
You know Jesus. You spoke to him.

139
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,620
求你了  我的兒子在哪兒
Please, where's my son?

140
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,330
-他走了  -走了  去哪了
- He's gone.  - Gone? Where?

141
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,630
-別走  -求您了
- No. - Please.

142
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,810
-他被羅馬人抓走了  -羅馬人
- The Romans have him.  - The Romans?

143
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,510
他從未說過羅馬的壞話
He's never said anything against Rome.

144
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,350
那麼
So,

145
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,960
告訴我你是誰
tell me who you are.

146
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,800
你是猶太人的王嗎
Are you the king of the Jews?

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,870
這話是你自己說的
Are you asking,

148
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,820
還是別人論我對你說的呢
or is it a question coming from others?

149
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,600
你是王麽
Are you a king?

150
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,740
你們人民和大祭司告訴我
That's what your own people and chief priest...

151
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,660
你自稱為王
tell me you claim to be.

152
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,320
我的國
My kingdom...

153
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
不屬這世界
is not of this world.

154
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,910
我的國若屬這世界
If it were,

155
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,930
我的臣僕必要爭戰  使我不至於被交給猶太人
my servants would fight my arrest.

156
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,130
只是我的國不屬這世界
My kingdom is from another place.

157
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,280
這樣  你是王麽
You are a king then.

158
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,020
你說我是王
You say that I am a king.

159
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,640
我為此而生
I have been born...

160
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,640
也為此來到世間
and come into the world...

161
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,690
要為給真理作見證
to testify to the truth.

162
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,200
凡屬真理的人
Everyone on the side of truth...

163
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,310
就會聽我的話
listens to me.

164
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,460
真理
Truth?

165
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,670
真理是什麼呢
What is truth?

166
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,940
那就是他
That's him.

167
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,900
我在夢中看到的男人  就是他
The man I saw in the dream. That's him!

168
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,770
他們想把他釘十字架
They want him crucified.

169
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,080
你不能這麼做
You can't.

170
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,690
他們說他會引發暴動
They say he could start a revolution.

171
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,070
你不必這樣做
You mustn't!

172
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,220
如果我不這麼做  
If I don't,

173
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,740
該亞法會將暴動怪罪於我
Caiaphas will blame any rebellion on me,

174
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,700
該撒會認為那是我的過錯
Caesar will see it as my failure.

175
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,730
他已經警告過我一次  
He has warned me once.

176
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,090
不會再給我第二次機會了
He is not going to warn me again.

177
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,130
那我就完了
I'll be finished.

178
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,820
我們就都完了
We'll be finished.

179
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,260
此人的罪行不過是有臆想症
He's guilty of nothing more than being deluded.

180
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,390
他觸犯了律法
He has broken the law.

181
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,300
是你的律法  而非該撒的
Your law, not Caesar's.

182
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,070
放他出來  教他點禮數
Get him out and teach him some respect.

183
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,000
打四十鞭
Forty lashes.

184
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,180
四十鞭
Forty lashes?

185
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,660
僅此而已嗎
Nothing more?

186
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,450
總督大人
Prefect,

187
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,070
眾人的一心企望著上帝
we cannot be held responsible...

188
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,000
倘若你釋放了一個
for what the people may do today...

189
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,950
觸犯我們神聖律法的人
with their eyes on God...

190
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,250
他們今日會做出何等舉動
if you release a man...

191
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,450
我們將無法負責
who has broken our sacred laws.

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,490
眾人
The people?

193
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,340
該撒頒布法令說
Caesar decrees...

194
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,480
在逾越節  我可以釋放一名犯人
I can release a prisoner at Passover.

195
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,350
那就讓眾人決定我手中哪一名犯人
Let the people decide which of the prisoners I hold...

196
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,110
將被釘上十字架
will be crucified.

197
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,430
過來
Come on!

198
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,660
動作快  跟上
Move your feet! Come on!

199
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,770
過來
Come on!

200
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,820
這兒  快跟上
Here! Quickly!

201
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,180
他們對他做了什麼
What have they done to him?

202
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,420
他們想要殺了他
They're going to kill him!

203
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,980
似乎一切都在他的預料之中
It's as if he knows this must happen.

204
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,210
這麼說你是王
So you're a king.

205
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,260
每個王都需要一個冠冕
Every king needs a crown.

206
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,940
站起來
Get up!

207
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,120
讓他們進來
Let them in.

208
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,960
-沒錯  -你  你  還有你
- Yes.  - You. You and you.

209
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,370
-你  -你
- You.  - You.

210
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,780
-沒錯  -你
- Yes.  - You.

211
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,900
在那兒等著  
Wait there.

212
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,110
不  你不行  回去  回去
No, not you. Back. Back.

213
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,060
不  退後  你不行  回去
No! Step back! Not you. Back.

214
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,630
不要推擠
No pushing!

215
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,610
讓我過去吧
Let me through!

216
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,320
回去  不行  不行
Back! No. No.

217
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,240
讓開
Gets the way!

218
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,840
關上門
Close the gates!

219
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,580
馬利亞  馬利亞  走吧
Hey! Mary! Mary, move.

220
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,290
走吧  我們走
Move. Let's go.

221
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,020
今天  逾越節開始了
Today, Passover begins.

222
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,640
你們的王  該撒提庇留
And your emperor, Tiberius Caesar,

223
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,270
將向民眾廣施恩澤以表祝福
makes you a gesture of good will-

224
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,920
隨眾人所要的
the release of a prisoner-

225
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,440
釋放一個囚犯給你們
chosen by you.

226
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,300
選擇權在你們
I give you a choice.

227
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,650
是巴拉巴
Barabbas-

228
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,290
一個危險的作亂者
a dangerous agitator,

229
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,050
和臭名昭著的殺人犯
a common murderer.

230
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,120
還是這個傳道者
Or this preacher,

231
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,720
他自稱是你們的王
who claims to be your king.

232
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,770
他才不是我們的王
He is not our king!

233
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,980
我們的王  只有該撒
We have no king but Caesar.

234
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,750
你們必須做出選擇
You must decide.

235
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,340
我們選巴拉巴
We choose Barabbas.

236
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,410
-釋放巴拉巴  -巴拉巴
- Free Barabbas. - Barabbas.

237
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,990
他是我們的兄弟
He's one of us.

238
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,220
釋放巴拉巴給我們
Give us Barabbas!

239
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,630
巴拉巴  巴拉巴
Barabbas! Barabbas!

240
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,610
釋放耶穌  釋放耶穌
Jesus! Jesus!

241
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,430
巴拉巴  巴拉巴
Barabbas! Barabbas!

242
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,190
你們選擇殺人犯
You choose a murderer?

243
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,400
釋放巴拉巴給我們
Give us Barabbas!

244
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,110
執行吧
Do it!

245
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,540
跟我走
Let's go.

246
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,390
那這先知呢
And the prophet?

247
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,350
這等僭妄之人怎麼會是我們的王呢
How could this blasphemer be our king?

248
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,630
他才不是我們的王
He's not our king.

249
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,370
把他釘十字架
Crucify him!

250
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,920
處死他
Kill him!

251
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,690
把他釘十字架
Crucify him!

252
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,440
-赦免他  -救救他
- Spare him! - Save him!

253
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,020
-處死他  -把他釘十字架
- Kill him! - Crucify him!

254
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,230
了結他這痛苦的生命吧
Put him out of his misery!

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,160
-把他釘十字架  -把他釘十字架
- Crucify him! - Crucify him!

256
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,450
把他釘十字架
Crucify him!

257
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,410
你們怎能處決這人  卻赦免殺人犯呢
How can you condemn this man and spare a murderer?

258
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,920
把他釘十字架
Crucify him!

259
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,130
僭妄者
Blasphemer!

260
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,760
好吧
Very well.

261
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,050
把他釘十字架
Crucify him!

262
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,820
除掉他吧
Let him die!

263
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,710
不要
No!

264
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,720
你  退後
You! Get back!

265
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,630
請釋放他吧
Release him!

266
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,700
快走
Move!

267
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,960
羅馬人渣
Roman scum!

268
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,000
他們怎能如此對他
How can they treat him like this?

269
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,680
約翰  我要去見他
John, I need to see him.

270
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,600
我要去見我的兒子
I need to see my son.

271
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,690
退後
Get back!

272
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,540
退後
Get back!

273
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,290
快走
Move them back!

274
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,010
和散那  和散那  和散那
Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!

275
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,900
後邊去
Get back there!

276
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,360
羅馬殺手
Roman murderers!

277
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,420
不  耶穌  來人幫幫他
No! Jesus! Somebody help him!

278
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,380
可憐可憐他吧
Show him mercy!

279
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,640
不要
No!

280
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,140
退後  別過來
Get back! Stay back!

281
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,730
我的孩子
My son.

282
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

283
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,210
對上帝而言  萬事皆有可能
Everything is possible with God.

284
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,260
快走
Move forward!

285
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,340
耶穌  耶穌
Jesus! Jesus!

286
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,910
求你們了  她是他母親
Please, she's his mother!

287
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,320
退後  後邊去
Get back! Further back!

288
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,740
退後
Get back!

289
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,160
來人幫幫他
Somebody help him!

290
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,930
求你們了
Please!

291
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,120
你
You!

292
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,320
幫他背十字架

294
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,540
我的主
My Lord.

295
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,000
總督大人  他十字架上的牌子要怎麼寫
What will the sign on his cross say, Prefect?

296
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,010
用希伯來  羅馬  希利尼三語書寫
Put in Arqmaic, Latin and Greek

297
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,330
"猶太人的王  拿撒勒人耶穌"
"Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews."

298
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,580
他從不是我們的王
He was never our king.

299
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,430
必須寫作  "這個人自稱...
It must read, "This man said...

300
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,940
我是猶太人的王"
'I am the king of the Jews."'

301
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,270
我說什麼就是什麼  寫猶太人的王
It stays as I 've commanded. The king of the Jews.

302
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,860
懦夫
Cowards!

303
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,180
滾開
Get away!

304
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,590
滾開
Get away!

305
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,860
我的主  保佑你
My Lord. Bless you.

306
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,450
謝謝
Thank you.

307

313
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,420
快走
Move!

314
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,280
來吧  王
Come on, king.

315
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,080
快點
Come on!

316
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,440
來吧  開始吧
Come on. Come on!

317
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,590
把他放到十字架上
Get him up on the cross!

318
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,130
快點
Come on!

319
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
不准靠近了
No further.

320
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,340
綁緊繩子
Secure the ropes.

321
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:51,030
猶太人的王  拿撒勒人耶穌[三語書寫]

322
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,690
你將為此事悔恨終生
You'll live to regret this.

323
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,860
我們又不是第一次殺猶太人了
Hardly the first Jew we've killed.

324
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,410
他不一樣
He was different.

325
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,040
他是眾神選中的人
He was chosen by the gods.

326
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,320
他以為他是
He thought he was.

327
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,040
一周之內  他就會被遺忘
He'll be forgotten in a week.

328
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,730
把他拉起來
Get him up there!

329
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,880
穩住
Steady!

330
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,530
穩住
Steady!

331
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,680
我的兒啊
My son.

332
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,620
猶太人的王
King of the Jews!

333
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,370
在上面能看到聖殿嗎
Can you see the temple from there?

334
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,880
滾開
Leave him.

335
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,450
父阿
Father!

336
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,420
父阿
Father!

337
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,280
原諒他們

338
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,950
他們不知道自己在做什麼
for they know not what they do.

339
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,250
你先來
You first.

340
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,980
真不走運
Bad luck.

341
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,220
你不是彌賽亞嗎
Aren't you the Messiah?

342
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,230
救你自己和我們吧
Why don't you save yourself and us?

343
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,690
我們受刑
Our punishment

344
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,890
是罪有應得
is just,

345
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,800
然而這個人...
but this man...

346
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,810
並沒有作過什麼不對的事
has done nothing wrong.

347
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,740
你的國降臨的時候  求你記念我

348
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,290
我實在告訴你
Truly I say to you,

349
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,940
今天
today,

350
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,680
你必定同我在樂園裡了
you will be with me in paradise.

351
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,310
母親
Mother,

352
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,600
以後他就是你兒子
this is your son.

353
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,450
約翰
John,

354
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,310
她就是你的親娘
this is your mother.

355
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,820
我的神
My God.

356
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,000
我的神
My God.

357
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,220
為甚麼離棄我
Why have you forsaken me?

358
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,180
我口渴
I thirst.

359
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,310
結束了
It's finished.

360
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,740
父阿
Father,

361
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,370
我把我的靈魂
into your hands...

362
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,880
交在你手裡
I commend my spirit.

363
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,770
-克勞迪婭  -這是一個征兆
- Claudia!  - This is an omen.

364
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,350
把屍體搬走
Take the body away.

365
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,150
等等
Wait!

366
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,080
我這有本丟．彼拉多的命令
I have an order from Pontius Pilate.

367
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,740
屍體是我們的
This body is ours.

368
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,260
給他們
Give it to them.

369
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,280
三天後

370
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,010
你去哪兒了
Where were you?

371
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,040
你本應是他的基石
You were supposed to be his rock.

372
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,140
我辜負了他
I failed him.

373
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,840
如今我不能請求他原諒我
Now I can't ask him to forgive me.

374
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,350
如果有任何需要就回來
Come back if you need anything.

375
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,310
我會的
I will.

376
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,350
祝你回加利利一路平安
Have a safe journey back to Galilee.

377
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,620
願主保佑你

378
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,360
你在找誰
Who are you looking for?

379
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,510
若是你把他移了去  請告訴我他在哪裡
If you've taken him, tell me where he is.

380
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,640
馬利亞

381
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,130
夫子
Teacher?

382
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,510
去告訴我們的弟兄們
Go and tell our brothers...

383
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,540
我回來了
I am here.

384
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,360
《聖經》下集預告

385
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,860
墓穴打開了  我看見他了
The tomb is open. I saw him!

386
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,620
彼得
Peter?

387
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,200
他沒死  他回來了
He hasn't gone. He's back.

388
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,460
你看見我了
Because you see me,

389
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,250
說明你信我
you believe.

390
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,210
不  這不是真的
No, this isn't real.

391
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,510
多馬  不要疑惑
Thomas, stop doubting.

392
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,430
真的是你
It is you.

393
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,510
當聖靈降臨在你們身上
When the holy spirit comes to you,

394
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,390
你們就必領受能力

395
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,690
我奉耶穌基督的名  叫你起來行走
In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk.

396
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,840
耶穌顯靈了
Jesus did this!

397
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,150
他們又在喊那個低賤之人的名字了
They're shouting that wretched man's name again!

398
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,040
如果你們再妖言惑眾
You will be silent,

399
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,660
我就讓你們再也出不了聲
or you will be silenced.

400
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,630
你褻瀆了神
Blasphemer!

401
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,540
我們不怕死
We are not afraid of death.

402
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,460
大數的保羅
Paul of Tarsus.

403
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,710
我能為你除掉這個渣滓

告訴你的朋友

405
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,290

告訴我你是誰
Tell me who you are!

所有人皆可進此門

411
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,530
你必須和我們走一趟

412
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,940
我們於苦難中歡欣
We rejoice in our suffering.

413
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,110
雅各
James!

414
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,350
不
No!

415
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,360
不再有死亡
There will be no more death...

416
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,090
也不再有悲哀
or mourning...

417
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,900
哭號
or crying...

418
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,870
疼痛

419
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,670
總有東西要留傳下去
Something must survive.

420
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,820
如果我不活不了
If not me,

421
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,540
至少要讓我的話留傳下去
then my words at least.

422
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:06,970
我必快來
I am coming soon.
