00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,910
本劇改編自聖經  它們曾改變世界
本劇將始終保持《聖經》真諦

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,130
《聖經》前情提要
Previously on The Bible.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,780
退後
Back!

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,730
馬利亞  很快你將生下一子
Mary, you will soon give birth to a son-

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
神的兒子
the Son of God.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,630
有星要出於雅各
A star shall come out of Jacob,

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,350
有杖要興於以色列
and a scepter shall rise out of lsrael.

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,970
我相信您的兒子必是其子民未來的王
I believe your son is the promised king of his people.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,760
他叫什麼名字
What is his name?

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,400
耶穌
Jesus.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,950
他的名字是耶穌
His name is Jesus.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,320
即將到來的那一位  大過我
There is one to come greater than me.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,100
我不過是曠野中的吶喊  做好準備迎接
I'm just a voice in the wilderness, preparing the way for the-

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,590
上帝
Lord.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,570
起來  走走
Get up and walk.

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,300
這個來自加利利的擾亂者是個麻煩
This agitator from Galilee- he's trouble.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,570
有人說那個耶穌把一個死人救活了
They say this Jesus has raised a man from the dead.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,740
上帝會將他的忿怒降在所有人身上
God will bring his wrath down upon all of us,

19
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,350
誰知道彼拉多會做出什麼
and who knows what Pilate will do?

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,020
大人  有個猶太人最近在聖殿裡惹麻煩
Sir, a Jew has been causing trouble in the temple.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,270
你們不能侍奉主的同時  又侍奉金錢
You cannot serve God and money.

22
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,530
如果這場騷亂在第二天依然繼續的話
If the disturbances that took place today are repeated tomorrow,

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,010
我將立刻關閉聖殿
I will shut the tempie immediately.

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,550
毀了這殿  我會在三日之內重新建立起來
Destroy this temple, and I will build it again in three days.

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,640
他威脅說要拆毀聖殿
He threatens to destroy the temple.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,750
我們得除掉他  否則羅馬人會毀滅一切
We remove this man, or the Romans destroy everything.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,780
-處死  -沒錯
- Execute? - Yes.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,260
犧牲這農夫的命  換取上帝之國的到來
The life of one peasant for the future of God's nation.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,400
你必因此事後悔終生
You'lI live to regret this.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,830
一周之後就沒人會記得他是誰了
He'll be forgotten in a week.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,260
我的兒子
My son!

32
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,000
你們心裡固然願意  肉體卻太軟弱
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,820
父啊  赦免他們吧
Father! Forgive them,

34
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,110
因為他們並不知曉他們所作所為
for they know not what they do.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,210
你去哪兒了  你本應是他的磐石
Where were you? You were supposed to be his rock.

36
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,860
我辜負了他  不敢請求他的原諒
I failed him. Now I can't ask him to forgive me.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,250
馬利亞
Mary.

38
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,860
我來了
I am here.

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,510
聖經

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,510
彼得  彼得
Peter. Peter!

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,770
大家  墳墓打開了
Everyone. The tomb is open.

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,520
-他還活著  -什麼
- He's alive. - What?

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,290
我看見他了
I saw him.

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,130
那不可能
That's not possible.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,020
不  我看見了
No. I saw him.

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,420
馬利亞  那可能是其他人
Mary, maybe it was someone else.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,610
你們覺得我瘋了
You think I'm mad.

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,480
彼得  你去看看那墳墓吧
Peter, see the tomb for yourself.

49
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,310
求你了
Please.

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,090
彼得
Peter?

51
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,650
現在你相信了嗎
Now do you believe me?

52
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,950
但他走了
But he's gone.

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,540
走了
Gone?

54
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,730
不
No.

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,930
他回來了
He's back.

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,400
對  非常新鮮的餅哦
Yes, very fresh. The bread is fresh.

57
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,730
謝謝
Thank you.

58
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,630
杯子  我需要杯子和一點酒
A cup. I need a cup and some wine.

59
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,920
怎麼了
What happened?

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,860
他的身體
His body.

61
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,020
他的血
His blood.

62
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,340
我就是道路
I am the way,

63
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,500
真理
the truth...

64
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,460
生命
and the life.

65
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,560
不
No.

66
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,460
不  這不是真的
No, this isn't real.

67
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,770
主
Lord.

68
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,360
多馬
Thomas.

69
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,310
不要疑惑
Stop doubting...

70
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,950
總要信
and believe.

71
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,440
真的是你
It is you.

72
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,310
你因看見了我
Because you see me,

73
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,260
才信
you believe.

74
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,740
那沒有看見
Blessed are those...

75
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,560
就信的
who have not seen me...

76
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,480
有福了
and yet... have believed.

77
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,150
四十天之後

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,020
當聖靈降臨在你們身上
When the Holy Spirit comes to you,

79
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,020
你們就必得著能力
you'll receive power.

80
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,260
聖靈的力量
The power of the Holy Spirit...

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,120
能伴隨你們所有人  不論你們身在何處
can be with you all, wherever you are.

82
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,010
你們往普天下去
Go into the world...

83
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,430
傳福音給萬民聽
and preach the gospel to all creation.

84
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,020
願你們平安
Peace be with you.

85
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,530
距逾越節當天耶穌被釘在十字架上
It's 50 days since Passover-

86
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,080
已經過去50天了
the day Jesus was crucified.

87
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,050
如今成千上萬的猶太朝聖者來到耶路撒冷
Now thousands of Jewish pilgrims come to Jerusalem...

88
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,780
慶祝五旬節
for the festival of Pentecost.

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,970
必須是基督徒
Must be Christians.

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,480
有耶穌追隨者出現的跡象嗎
Any sign of Jesus' followers?

91
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,800
沒有
No.

92
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,480
我認為他們都已經回到加利利去了
I assume they've all gone back to Galilee.

93
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,900
你怎麼看
Do you?

94
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,870
讓你的人做好準備就可以了
Just make sure your men are ready.

95
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,100
如果他們回來了  你要對付他們
If they return, you have to deal with them.

96
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,900
我不能再煽動羅馬人一次
I cannot call upon the Romans again.

97
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,770
他在那
There he is.

98
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,570
司提反
Stephen.

99
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
你在這裡我們很高興  兄弟
We're glad you're here, brother.

100
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,870
往這邊走
This way.

101
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,170
我們還是小心點  他們在看著我們
We must be careful though. They're watching us.

102
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,290
約翰  你們都安全我很高興
John, I'm glad you're all safe.

103
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,650
又見到你很高興  司提反
It's good to see you again, Stephen.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,330
馬太
Matthew.

105
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,650
它會以什麼形式出現
What form will it take?

106
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,350
它什麼時候來
When will it come?

107
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,880
耶穌說過我們要做的就是問
Jesus said all we had to do is ask.

108
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,560
我一直在問  每天都問
I have been asking. Every day.

109
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,930
恰當之時聖靈就會降臨
The Holy Spirit will come when the time is right.

110
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,730
我覺得我們應該共同祈禱
I think we should pray together.

111
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,220
我們在天上的父
Our Father, who is in heaven,

112
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,010
願人都尊你的名為聖
hallowed be your name.

113
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,710
願你的國降臨
Your kingdom come, your will be done,

114
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,430
願你的旨意行在地上  如同行在天上
on earth as it is in heaven.

115
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,930
我們日用的飲食  今日賜給我們
Give us this day our daily bread,

116
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,690
免我們的債
and forgive us our trespasses,

117
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,460
如同我們免了人的債
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

118
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,360
不叫我們遇見試探
And lead us not into temptation-

119
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
救我們脫離凶惡
but deliver us from evil.

120
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,420
發生什麼事了
What's happening?

121
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,940
看那風  看那雲
The wind! The clouds!

122
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,640
耶穌是救世主

123
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,280
先知曾預言過

124
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,260
他被釘上十字架  但是死而復生

125
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,470
耶穌是救世主

126
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,110
我見到他被釘上十字架

127
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:34,080
然後死而復生

128
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,270
頌贊歸於上帝

129
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,890
他被釘上十字架然後死而復生

130
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,810
跟隨猶太人

131
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,890
和所有居住在耶路撒冷的人們

132
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,840
耶穌是救世主

133
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,110
在天上我要顯出奇事  在地下我要顯出神跡

134

馬利亞
Mary?

146
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,890
當聖靈降臨在你們身上
When the Holy Spirit comes to you,

147
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,880
你們就必得著能力
you'll receive power.

148
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,430
金銀我都沒有
I don't have silver or gold.

149
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,950
只把我所有的給你
But what I have I will give you.

150
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,400
我奉拿撒勒人耶穌基督的名
In the name of Jesus Christ,

151
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,930
我們的主和救主
our Lord and Savior,

152
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,680
叫你起來
rise up...

153
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,020
行走吧
and walk.

154
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,780
-快來看看  -怎麼了
- Come and see this. - Huh? Huh?

155
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,340
太神奇了
It's amazing.

156
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,360
你們覺得我們憑自己的能力使他痊愈了嗎
Do you think he is healed by our power?

157
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,590
是因為耶穌  他還沒死
It is through Jesus. He did not die.

158
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,780
他仍與我們同在
He is still with us.

159
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,320
是他的能力使這人行走
It is his power that made this man walk.

160
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,540
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this.

161
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,470
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this.

162
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,250
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this!

163
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,680
耶穌做到的  耶穌做到的
Jesus did this! Jesus did this!

164
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,960
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this!

165
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,740
耶穌
Jesus!

166
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,710
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this!

167
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
耶穌
Jesus!

168
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,470
耶穌做到的
Jesus did this!

169
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,380
耶穌做到的  耶穌
Jesus did this. Jesus!

170
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,570
耶穌做到的  耶穌做到的
Jesus did this! Jesus did this!

171
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,720
他們在說什麼
What are they saying?

172
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,250
他們又在喊那苦命男人的名字
They're shouting that wretched man's name again.

173
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,930
他們說他治好了那個乞丐
They say he cured the beggar.

174
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,250
把帶頭者抓來
Bring the ringleaders to me.

175
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,310
還有那個說謊的乞丐
And that lying beggar.

176
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
這邊
This way.

177
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,930
這裡  坐下
There. Sit down.

178
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,220
趴下  別動
Get down. Don't move.

179
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,710
他們今天有多少人反叛了
How many have they turned today?

180
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,080
估計有5000人
We think 5,000.

181
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,250
5000人
5,000.

182
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,320
5000人
5,000.

183
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,630
告訴我
Tell me,

184
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,620
你為何覺得可以
why did you think it would be acceptable

185
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,460
以死去的異教徒之名傳福音
to preach in the name of a dead heretic?

186
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,390
耶穌沒有死
Jesus isn't dead.

187
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,410
他還活著
He lives.

188
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,550
他被處死了  他死了
He was executed. He is dead.

189
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,780
今天是耶穌基督的能力使這人能行走
This man walks today only through the power of Jesus Christ.

190
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,720
真的嗎
Really?

191
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,190
他生來就是跛子
He has been lame since birth.

192
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,320
行  我明白了
Yes. I see.

193
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,940
你不允許再提起這個乞丐
You are not allowed to speak of this beggar...

194
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,500
或者你死去的彌賽亞
or your dead Messiah...

195
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,710
從現在開始
from this moment on.

196
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,660
這是真理
It is the truth.

197
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,410
-提到他是我們的義務  -義務
- We have a duty to speak it. - Duty?

198
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,020
義務
Duty?

199
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,230
我的義務是
I have a duty...

200
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,550
我們的聖殿  我們的國家
to our temple, to our nation,

201
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,730
和我們的神
to our God!

202
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,990
我同時掌控律法
I also have the law.

203
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,720
我有能力
I have the power,

204
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,200
而且你也在我這兒
and I have you here.

205
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,530
你要麼沉默
You will be silent,

206
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,940
否則就讓你永遠沉默
or you will be silenced.

207
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,980
把他們帶走
Take them away.

208
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,260
來吧
Right, come on!

209
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,790
我們不懼死亡
We are not afraid of death.

210
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,810
奉耶穌基督的名受洗
Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

211
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,230
叫你們的罪得赦
You can all be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins.

212
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,240
他被釘十字架  卻死裡復活
He was crucified, but he rose from the dead!

213
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,180
不可能的  不要聽信他
Impossibie! Don't listen to him.

214
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,280
你為何要抵擋耶穌
Why do you resist Jesus?

215
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,210
是他拯救了你
He is your Savior.

216
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,480
引導我們走永生的道路
The way to everlasting life!

217
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,190
耶穌死了
Jesus is dead!

218
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,630
而你將重蹈他的覆轍
And you'll go the same way.

219
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,260
-僭妄者  -不
- Blasphemer! - No!

220
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,250
耶穌還活著
Jesus is alive.

221
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,010
他們試圖殺了他  但失敗了
They tried to kill him, but they failed.

222
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,820
他是一位真正的先知
He is a true prophet.

223
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,870
是我們的彌賽亞
Our Messiah!

224
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,190
你對先知了解多少
What do you know about the prophets?

225
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,870
你所謂的先知將自己凌駕於律法之上
Your prophet put himself above the law.

226
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,270
這個男孩什麼都不知道
This boy knows nothing.

227
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,500
我讀過聖經
I know the Scriptures!

228
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,030
是嗎
Really?

229
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,620
那你應該知道申命記
Then you'll know Deuteronomy.

230
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,790
因為他試圖
Because he sought...

231
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,940
勾引你們離開耶和華  你們的神
to entice you away from the Lord. Your God,

232
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,340
"你要先下手
"Your hand shall be the first against him,

233
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,080
要用石頭
and you shall stone him with stones...

234
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,050
打死他"
until he dies!"

235
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,960
我看見天開了
I see the heavens opening.

236
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,330
人子站在神的右邊
And the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.

237
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,350
-大數的保羅  -是的  大祭司
- Paul of Tarsus. - Yes, High Priest.

238
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,280
今天的事件可能會引發暴動
That incident today could have started a riot.

239
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,430
他是個異教徒
He was a heretic.

240
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,860
他試圖引導我們的人民遠離上帝
He was trying to lead our peopie away from God.

241
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,950
罪有應得
He got what he deserved.

242
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,960
這是眾望所歸
It was the will of the people.

243
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,850
真的嗎
Was it really?

244
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
或許
Perhaps...

245
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,310
你和我
you and I...

246
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,090
可以一同為眾人了卻心願
might serve the people's will together.

247
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,030
我可以為你驅除這顆渣滓
I could flush this scum out for you,

248
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,980
但我需要幫助
but I need help.

249
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,790
你需要什麼幫助
What do you need?

250
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,800
人手
Men.

251
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,700
金錢
Money.

252
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,340
和你寫的介紹信
Letters of introduction from you.

253
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,880
馬勒古
Malchus.

254
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,830
我的人手隨你調配
My servant is at your disposal.

255
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,150
我們吃吧
Let us eat.

256
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,130
我們幸運地受惠-
We are blessed to receive-

257
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,060
兄弟姐妹們  
Brothers and sisters.

258
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,280
主耶穌
Our Lord Jesus,

259
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,120
被賣的那一夜
on the night of his betrayal,

260
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,690
拿起餅來
took bread.

261
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,630
祝謝了  就擘開
And when he'd given thanks, he broke the bread.

262
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,790
歡迎你  朋友   
Welcome. Friend.

263
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,720
請坐吧  
Please.

264
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,300
坐下來和我們一起吃
Sit with us and eat.

265
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,450
相信我
Trust me,

266
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,380
我並不是你們的朋友
I am not your friend.

267
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,700
抓住他們
Take them.

268
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,280
走  走  走  快
Go, go, go. Quickly.

269
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,500
快  快跑
Go on, run away!

270
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,980
這邊
This way!

271
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,920
告訴你所有的朋友們
Tell all your friends,

272
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,630
所有耶穌的追隨者
all you followers of Jesus,

273
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,770
我  大數的保羅  會找到你們的
that I, Paul of Tarsus, will find you!

274
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,370
上帝
God...

275
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,960
與我同在
is on my side!

276
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,880
他們去哪了
Where did they go?

277
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,670
忽然間就沒人宣揚耶穌了
Suddenly no one's talking about Jesus.

278
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,810
我不相信他們會輕易背棄於他
I don't beileve they've just given up on him.

279
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,150
那
So...

280
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,900
他們去哪了
where are they?

281
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,160
我不知道  我發誓
I don't know. I swear.

282
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,980
大馬士革
Damascus.

283
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,680
有人提過要去大馬士革
Someone said Damascus.

284
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,170
真不知道他們為什麼要躲著我
I don't know why they run from me.

285
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,950
我使他們免於上帝的審判  他們本應感恩戴德
They should be grateful I'm saving them from God's judgment.

286
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,060
-他們還會敬畏上帝嗎  -根本不會
- Do they even care about God? - No.

287
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,890
他們離棄上帝於不顧
They abandoned God to follow

288
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,960
反而追隨這骯臟無知的渣滓
this dirty, uneducated scum.

289
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,900
繼續前進
Go on, hah!

290
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,360
你是誰
Who are you?

291
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,050
報上名來
Tell me who you are!

292
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:25,970
我就是你所迫害的耶穌
I am Jesus, whom you persecute.

293
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,640
不可能
No!

294
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,360
不可能
No!

295
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,740
耶穌已死
Jesus is dead.

296
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,480
不可能  不可能
No! No!

297
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,930
我的眼睛  我瞎了
My eyes. I'm blind.

298
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,950
主
Lord?

299
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,090
亞拿尼亞
Ananias.

300
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,560
到那叫"直街"的路上去
Go to the street called Straight.

301
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,770
找一個大數人  名叫保羅
Ask for a man they call... Paul of Tarsus.

302
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,040
保羅
Paul?

303
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,360
但他與我們為敵
But he beats us.

304
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,600
他四處搜捕你的信徒
He arrests your followers everywhere.

305
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,140
他是我揀選的器皿  要把我的名
I have chosen him to proclaim my name to the world-

306
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,090
傳給外族人
to the gentiles,

307
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,480
君王
their kings...

308
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,510
和以色列人
and the sons of lsrael.

309
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,830
只管去吧
Go.

310
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,910
誰在那
Who's there?

311
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,230
你是誰
Who are you?

312
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,750
說話
Speak.

313
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,310
我是你要迫害的人之一
I am one of those you want to destroy.

314
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,290
請饒恕我
Forgive me.

315
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,810
是我錯冤了你們
I've wronged you.

316
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,270
是我誤解了上帝
I've wronged God.

317
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,880
我的靈魂已飽受煎熬
My soul is on fire.

318
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,090
請幫助我
Help me.

319
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,620
他是我揀選的器皿  宣揚我的名
I have chosen him to proclaim my name to the world.

320
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,090
主打發我來
I am sent by God.

321
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,700
叫你能看見
For you.

322
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,090
我認得你
I know you.

323
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,580
你去過我家
You came to my house.

324
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,700
不
No.

325
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,770
不  請別拋下我
No. No. Don't leave me.

326
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,880
不  請別拋下我
No. Don't leave me.

327
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,540
我  亞拿尼亞
I, Ananias,

328
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,030
奉基督耶穌之名  為你  保羅  施洗
baptize you, Paul, in the name of Jesus Christ,

329
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,970
因你是他揀選的器皿  奉他的名改變世界
for he has chosen you to change the world in his name.

330
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,080
奉基督耶穌之名
In the name of Jesus Christ.

331
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,090
耶路撒冷

332
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,920
傳言大數人保羅的眼盲已經痊愈
They say that Paul of Tarsus has recovered from his blindness...

333
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,440
還成為了基督徒
and joined the Galileans.

334
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,630
我替您抓他回來
I'll find him for you.

335
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,550
然後如何
And then?

336
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,060
我要再遣人抓你回來嗎
Will I have to send someone after you?

337
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,500
不必了
No.

338
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,090
放他們去吧
Let them go.

339
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,160
如迦瑪列所言  人為之事
As Gamaliel said, if this is man's work,

340
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,900
必將潰敗
it will not succeed.

341
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,540
上帝之旨
If it is God's,

342
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,990
無以抗拒
we cannot fight it.

343
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,420
保羅的信仰改變了
Paul may have converted,

344
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,790
但世上仍有許多人想要鏟除耶穌的追隨者
but there are still many keen to stamp out Jesus' followers.

345
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,540
把他帶出來
Bring him out.

346
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,620
約翰的兄長  門徒雅各
The disciple James, brother of John,

347
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,670
被當權者逮捕
has been captured by the authorities.

348
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,690
約翰
John.

349
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,210
退後
Keep back.

350
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,950
不
No!

351
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,880
-冷靜  -把屍體處理掉
- Come on. - Get rid of him.

352
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,140
約翰
John.

353
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,500
聽我說  我們必須離開耶路撒冷
Come on. We must leave Jerusalem.

354
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,160
耶穌把我們帶來這裡
Jesus brought us here.

355
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,740
為我們...  送了命
He died here... for us.

356
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,190
太危險了
It is too dangerous.

357
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,570
要是我們留在這兒  都活不了
If we stay, we will all die.

358
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,360
我不畏懼死亡
I'm not afraid of death.

359
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,450
我們都不畏懼
None of us are.

360
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,590
但是多馬說得對
But Thomas is right.

361
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,770
要是我們死了  就無法為耶穌傳道
We can't speak of Jesus if we're dead.

362
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,270
一路平安  朋友們
Travel safely, my friends.

363
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,580
約翰  我知道和關愛之人別離很艱難
John, I know it is hard to part from the people you love,

364
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,650
但你並非孤身一人
but you are not alone.

365
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,900
永遠不會
You never will be.

366
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,450
很多事變了
Much has changed.

367
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,960
-你準備去哪兒  -可能去北邊吧
- Where will you go? - North probably.

368
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,060
去以弗所
To Ephesus.

369
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,250
祝你好運
Good luck.

370
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,530
我們定會再見的  彼得
We will meet again, Peter.

371
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,520
不是在人間  就是在天堂
On earth or in heaven.

372
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,940
門徒們從耶路撒冷出發
Driven from Jerusalem,

373
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,600
成為了傳教士
the disciples become missionarles-

374
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,300
也就是使徒
apostles-

375
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,230
將新信仰的種子傳遍五湖四海
spreading the seeds of a new faith far and wide.

376
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,460
保羅行的路最遠
No one goes further than Paul.

377
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,800
他讓地中海一帶上百人改變了信仰
He converts hundreds across the Mediterranean.

378
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,080
謝謝
Thank you.

379
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,750
不過他一直無法擺脫迫害別人的過去
But his previous life as a persecutor haunts him.

380
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,290
我是大數人保羅
Paul of Tarsus.

381
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,480
我們知道你是誰
We know who you are.

382
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,060
就是他
That's him.

383
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,980
我沒惡意
I mean you no harm.

384
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,970
我在大馬士革有朋友
I have friends in Damascus.

385
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,770
你去拜訪過他們
You paid them a visit.

386
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,690
狠狠地傷害了他們
You meant them plenty of harm.

387
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,240
我改過自新了
I've changed.

388
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,010
我曾經失明了  但現在又能看得真切了
I was blind. Now I can see.

389
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,390
騙子
Liar.

390
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,780
我以前那麼做是因為我確信自己是正確的
I did what I did because I was certain I was right.

391
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,730
確信自己了解上帝的...  心意
That I knew what God... wanted.

392
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,500
就像你們現在如此確信一般
As you are certain now.

393
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,910
然後耶穌來找我
But then Jesus came to me.

394
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,590
不是因為義憤或是裁決
Not in righteous anger or in judgment,

395
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,930
而是...
but...

396
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,130
以愛之名
in love.

397
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,990
若沒有愛  我們便算不得什麼
And without love, we are nothing.

398
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,570
愛是恆久忍耐
Love is-is patient.

399
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,120
又有恩慈
Love is kind.

400
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,770
愛是不嫉妒  不自誇
It is not jealous. It does not boast.

401
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,750
不張狂
It is not proud.

402
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,460
不計較人的過犯
It keeps no records of wrongs. It-It-

403
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,450
只喜歡真理
It rejoices with the truth.

404
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,460
凡事包容
It bears all things.

405
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,920
凡事相信
It believes all things.

406
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,160
凡事盼望
It hopes all things,

407
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,670
凡事忍耐
It endures all things.

408
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,870
現在常存的
When everything else disappears,

409
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:02,930
有信  有望  有愛這三樣
faith, hope and love remain.

410
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,290
其中最大的...
But the greatest of these...

411
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,100
是愛
is love.

412
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,870
你叫什麼名字
What is your name?

413
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,160
路加
Luke.

414
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,180
跟從我  路加
Come with me, Luke.

415
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,950
我無法獨自完成
I can't do this alone.

416
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,360
彼得
Peter.

417
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,370
你做了如此多
You have done so much.

418
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,760
我為你而驕傲  我得人的漁夫
I am proud of you, my fisher of men.

419
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,510
我的主
My Lord.

420
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,470
我做了你告訴我要做的
I've done what you told me.

421
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,650
我們在整個猶太傳你的福音
We preach your word throughout Judaea.

422
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,160
這只是個開始
That is just the beginning.

423
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,960
世上還有很多人...
There are many across the world...

424
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,120
會想要聽你傳播福音
who will want to hear you.

425
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,040
沒有你...
Without you,

426
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,200
那只...
it's just-

427
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,690
應羅馬的名義  把門打開
Open up in the name of Rome.

428
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,000
應門吧
Answer it.

429
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,970
記住
Remember.

430
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,920
大門向所有人敞開
The door is open to everyone.

431
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,960
你必須跟我們走
You must come with us.

432
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,510
百夫長哥尼流想要見你
Centurion Cornelius wants you.

433
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,410
記住  大門向所有人敞開
Remember. The door is open to everyone.

434
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,700
一位天使向我顯現...
An angel came to me...

435
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,880
讓我去找你
and told me to find you,
